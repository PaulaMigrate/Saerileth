@15   = ~(Saerileth's stricken faces contrasts with her brave words, and she returns to her place, weeping softly.)~
@16   = ~Aye. (Saerileth's shy reply is scarcely audible.) I am jealous of thy heart.~

@88   = ~Thou--my <CHARNAME>. (Saerileth says nothing more, but she presses your hand.)~
@89   = ~'Tis certain so. For a year didst we dwell together in the Temple of Tyr in Sigil. He was a great master to me, most gentle, just, and courteous.~

@99   = ~I'm not surprised. It was an astonishing situation.~

@101  = ~Damn Tyr already!~
@102  = ~I have learned that justice without mercy is cold, heartless, and canst even be--unjust.~
@103  = ~Do you mean you don't follow Tyr anymore?!~
@104  = ~I see what you mean.~
@105  = ~I disagree. Justice must stay pure, unpolluted even by mercy.~
@106  = ~Nay! (Saerileth's answer is immediate.)~
@107  = ~But I understand at last why the Crying God doth serve Tyr. In the union of Justice and suffering, mercy is born.~
@108  = ~(Saerileth laughs.) And what sayest thou? What is the relation of justice and mercy?~
@109  = ~I've never thought much about it before.~
@110  = ~I agree with you.~
@111  = ~I disagree. Justice must be kept pure of any alloy, even that of mercy.~
@112  = ~I am glad, <CHARNAME>, that thou, too, dost see it so. 'Tis a frightening thought.~
@113  = ~(Saerileth's voice is pensive.) If the gods were without mercy, how could we stand before them?~
@114  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, I cannot see it so. Would it have been justice to have slain Kesevar? (Saerileth does not wait for you to respond.)~
@115  = ~'Twould have seemed just to have taken his life. He spilled blood in the Hallows of Justice. He did not deny it.~
@116  = ~Yet not to have done so would have been the greater wrong. Yet without mercy he wouldst have been slain, justly, for his crime--yet where would have been the justice in slaying him for that which he couldst not avoid?~
@117  = ~Nay, I have learned at last, and I shall not forget it.~
@118  = ~(Saerileth nods, her eyes grave.) Too oft we are guilty of not thinking of such things.~
@119  = ~The sins we commit against the gods are as like to be of omission as of commission.~
@120  = ~What didst thou learn? (Saerileth's interest is plain in her voice.)~
@121  = ~I learned that there is no pleasing Tyr!~
@122  = ~I learned that Saerileth is wise indeed.~
@123  = ~First, what did *you* learn?~
@124  = ~Nay, <CHARNAME>! (There is horror in Saerileth's face.) Speak not such foolish blasphemies!~
@125  = ~The Evenhanded Tyr didst both test the worthiness of his Chosen and grant justice tempered with mercy to his faithful servant, Kesevar of the Azure Eyes.~
@126  = ~(Saerileth takes your hand looks up earnestly into your face.) Is't truly thy thought of Tyr?~
@127  = ~Yes. Tyr is impossible to please.~
@128  = ~No, but it was hard for me to understand.~
@129  = ~You know, I'm tired of this conversation. (Kiss Saerileth.)~
@130  = ~(Saerileth blushes at the praise but shakes her head.) Hadst I been wise, 'twould not have been new to me to know that justice without mercy is cold, heartless, and canst even be--unjust.~
@131  = ~There is much that thou oughtst to learn, <CHARNAME>. I will teach thee more of Tyr.~
@132  = ~From such a teacher, I'd learn anything!~
@133  = ~That's a lesson I *don't* want to learn.~
@134  = ~There is much I would like to learn.~
@135  = ~You presume to teach a godchild?~
@136  = ~(Saerileth places her hands on your chest.) There is a time for everything, and this is not the time to think such thoughts.~
@137  = ~My words were gravely spoken, and yet thy thoughts were light. (Saerileth sighs and kisses your nose.)~
@138  = ~Yet I cannot deny thee.~
@139  = ~Thy flattery is unneeded between us, <CHARNAME>. (Saerileth smiles.)~
@140  = ~Truth only treads the path between two loving hearts.~
@141  = ~My life is given unto Tyr's service, and if thou wishest not to know him, then thou wishest not to know me.~
@142  = ~Exactly.~
@143  = ~No, no, Saerileth. I *do* want to know you, even if it means knowing Tyr.~
@144  = ~I presume naught, <CHARNAME>. I wish only to teach thee more of the Maimed Tyr. 'Tis folly to reject out of hand that which thou dost not know.~
@145  = ~Then it shall be as thou desirest, <CHARNAME>.~
@146  = ~(Saerileth turns away from you, her face ashen and her eyes streaming with silent tears.)~
@147  = ~(Saerileth's voice is shaken, though she smiles gently.)~
@148  = ~Then I shall teach you, my <CHARNAME>.~
@149  = ~Aye, indeed. I am ever desirous to know more of Tyr and his justice, and now I have learned that justice without mercy is cold, heartless, and canst even be--unjust.~
@150  = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>. (Saerileth gently smooths your brow.) Rest well.~
@151  = ~If thou tirest of Tyr, then thou tirest of me.~
@152  = ~But this thou knowest well already. It shall be as thou desirest, <CHARNAME>.~
@153  = ~(You see Saerileth lying on her back a little way from the fire, gazing up into the sky. She sighs softly.)~

@156  = ~What is it?~
@157  = ~You shouldn't lie so far from the fire. It's dangerous.~
@158  = ~These stars are so strange to me. The stars of Mount Celestia are different. 'Tis lonely to look up into the sky and not see the Hammer or the Scales.~
@159  = ~There are beauties in the Prime sky, too.~
@160  = ~Where would the Hammer have been?~
@161  = ~My favorite constellation is the Hunter. (Point.)~
@162  = ~I doubt it not. (Saerileth sits up and smiles.)~
@163  = ~Still, though there is beauty in the unfamiliar, 'tis different from the stars of my childhood.~
@164  = ~At least Toril *hath* stars. Sigil didst not.~
@165  = ~Sigil doesn't have stars?~
@166  = ~Sigil nights must be very dark.~
@167  = ~(Kiss Saerileth's nose.) You're adorable.~
@168  = ~There. (Saerileth points to a spot in the northwestern sky.) The brightest star in the sky is the Hammer.~
@169  = ~(Saerileth sits up and smiles.) Still, at least Toril *hath* stars. Sigil didst not.~
@170  = ~'Tis beautiful. (Saerileth sits up, following your tracing finger in the sky.)~
@171  = ~I am glad at least that Toril *hath* stars, strange though they are to me. Sigil had none.~
@172  = ~Aye, Sigil hath nor stars nor sun. The days are lit by a strange, nebulous light without a source.~
@173  = ~The nights are not so dark, though, for the lights of the city are ever-present. Sigil is shaped like a wheel, and the city is on the inner side.~
@174  = ~Thou couldst look up and see the city above thee, if ever a day were clear enough.~
@175  = ~But I prefer the stars.~
@176  = ~Nay, not so dark. Sigil hath nor stars nor sun. The days are lit by a strange, nebulous light without a source.~
@177  = ~(Saerileth smiles and kisses your cheek.) Thou art kind to take my star-folly for sweetness.~
@178  = ~The nights in Sigil are not so very dark, for the lights of the city are ever-present. Sigil is shaped like a wheel, and the city is on the inner side.~
@179  = ~Forgive me. (Saerileth draws closer to the fire.)~
@180  = ~'Tis just that these stars are so strange to me. The stars of Mount Celestia are different. 'Tis lonely to look up into the sky and not see the Hammer or the Scales.~
@181  = ~My heart, thy fate is soon to be decided. Thou shalt soon face thine enemy, and thy soul shall be won.~ [SAERI184]

@190  = ~It's only figurative. I'm still without a soul, and there's nothing we can do about it.~

@209  = ~No, Saerileth. I don't love you that way.~
@210  = ~Nay, <CHARNAME>, 'twas no figure of words. I spake of marriage, which wouldst indeed make of us a single soul.~
@211  = ~So--will you marry me, Saerileth?~

@311  = ~'Tis good to hear thee speak with such certainty, for here we battle powerful foes.~
@312  = ~'Tis a dark, foul, and unnatural place, <CHARNAME>. Great evil doth live in this sewer. (Saerileth covers her mouth in disgust.)~

@404  = ~The Cowled Wizards may be draconian in their application of the law, but their influence has kept Athkatla at peace for centuries. Maybe the end DOES sometimes justify the means if it keeps law from descending into chaos. What do you think, Saerileth?~

@459  = ~He lay there, silent, unmoving, and though he was yet young, there wast no bloom of health in his cheek.~
@460  = ~Boldly, I crept into his chamber--even now I know not why I did so--but thinking him ill, I went to lay more clothes upon his feet.~
@461  = ~I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone. (Saerileth's eyes lose their focus as she looks into the past.)~
@462  = ~And then I turned, and there he stood, behind me in the doorway, flickering even as did my candle flame.~
@463  = ~I felt no fear from the apparition, for there was no malice in his countenance. But I returned quickly to the chapel, and there we sang his death hymn.~
@464  = ~You saw his ghost?!~
@465  = ~Have you always been able to see ghosts?~
@466  = ~A fanciful tale.~
@467  = ~As thou wilt.~
@468  = ~Aye. 'Twas not the last time I have seen the dead. Oft I see them walking.~

@481  = ~I am ever desirous to know more of the nature of Tyr.~ [SAERI212]
@482  = ~(Saerileth's voice is unexpectedly grave.)~
@483  = ~'Tis for this reason that I live.~

@819  = ~Then my beloved is truly dead, and some fiend hath ta'en his place!~
@820  = ~(Saerileth takes your hands, her eyes anxiously searching your face.)~
@821  = ~Art returned to thyself? To me?~ [SAERI279]
@822  = ~Leave me alone, Saerileth.~
@823  = ~Saerileth, are you all right? I could have killed you!~
@824  = ~(Laugh.) I loved it! To be what I was meant to be!~
@825  = ~As thou wilt, <CHARNAME>.~
@826  = ~(Saerileth obediently takes her place in formation; but her worried eyes follow you, and you hear her murmuring your name in her prayers.)~
@827  = ~Thou wast transformed into--an avatar of murder.~
@828  = ~(There is infinite pity mingled with love in Saerileth's face.)~
@829  = ~I would rather die by thy side--even by thy hand--than to live apart from you.~
@830  = ~(Saerileth's voice does not falter.)~
@831  = ~Leave me alone for a while, Saerileth.~
@832  = ~And I could not bear it if I hurt you, Saerileth, you the one I love!~
@833  = ~There is naught to forgive, <CHARNAME>.~
@834  = ~I shall pray Tyr to defend thee in the struggle ahead.~
@835  = ~May the Maimed God shield us all. (And Saerileth places her hand on your brow as though giving a benediction.)~
@836  = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>. I swear it.~
@837  = ~Oh that one whose honor is so pure shouldst be so foully used!~
@838  = ~(And Saerileth returns to her place in formation, overcome.)~
@839  = ~Thou lovest me! (Saerileth throws her arms around your neck.)~
@840  = ~But that my pity for thy plight, heart of my heart, didst darken the light of mine eyes, I shouldst burst from too much of joy!~
@841  = ~(And, indeed, Saerileth's eyes are wet as she cradles your head against her shoulder.)~
@842  = ~Fear thou not, <CHARNAME>. Thy Saerileth shall be ever at thy side, to defend thee, even from the darkness within thy soul.~
@843  = ~Then I was the more deceived! The <CHARNAME> I thought that I had known was but vain fantasy.~
@844  = ~Some fiend hath ta'en his place!~
@845  = ~I am here, <CHARNAME>. Art thou well? Thou seemest yet pale? (Saerileth reaches out to touch your cheek.)~
@846  = ~Back away, Saerileth. I'm losing control.~
@847  = ~Run, Saerileth! Run!~
@848  = ~(Grab her hand and press it to your cheek.)~
@849  = ~Tyr defend us! Must it happen to thee again?~
@850  = ~I will not leave thee.~
@851  = ~<CHARNAME>, what aileth thee? Doth the malevolent spirit haunt thy dreams?~
@852  = ~I am here, beloved. I have watched by thy side.~
@853  = ~Art thou well? Thou seemest yet pale? (Saerileth reaches out to touch your cheek.)~
@854  = ~I will not leave thee, beloved. Not now, or ever.~
@855  = ~<CHARNAME>, our duty is clear. We must aid the Knights of the Vigil.~
@856  = ~Then you will consider it?~
@857  = ~The Watcher hath no dirty work, monster! <CHARNAME>, this fiend knoweth only lies!~ [SAERI301]
@858  = ~Silence, Chosen of Tyr! What do you say, child of Bhaal?~
@859  = ~Faithless fiend! Liar, as art all demons!~
@860  = ~Foolish mortal!~
@861  = ~Although this man be mad, 'tis best to be cautious. There may be demons on this level as well.~
@862  = ~Lots of demons, very scary! Yakman must get away!~
@863  = ~I make no bargains with fiends!~
@864  = ~Tyr does not lead this group! The Bhaalspawn does!~
@865  = ~And it shalt be thou!~
@866  = ~There may be no Blood War betwixt mortals and devils, but between ye and Tyr's Chosen, there is yet bloody constraint!~
@867  = ~But thy group is led by the spawn of Bhaal. Silence, slave of Tyr, lest all thy friends fall!~
@868  = ~Aye, but it doth seem to be *here*! For through every door we pass, we find some fiend, whether it be demon or devil!~
@869  = ~Aw, are we at our wit's end? Have we run out of patience? Has our endurance been taxed? Have perhaps our principles been compromised? (And the cambion laughs mockingly at Saerileth.)~
@870  = ~This ghost is holy, <CHARNAME>. Let us give him the honor he doth deserve.~
@871  = ~There is a presence here, powerful and fell. May Tyr preserve us and guide our steps in this dark place.~
@872  = ~Our folly? Thou art the false knight, Odren, and thou dost deserve what shall befall thee!~
@873  = ~Aye, far have ye fallen from the precepts of the Watcher. Duty is above all, is it not?~
@874  = ~(Saerileth's eyes are flaming as she continues.) If ye can, redeem yourselves in his sight, but think not that the way will be an easy one.~
@875  = ~May Helm put thy valor to thine account, for thou didst fight for him at the last.~
@876  = ~Odren and the rest shall receive from the Prince of Demons no more than justice! They have betrayed their most sacred trust!~
@877  = ~'Twould be best to do what is the will of Helm, <CHARNAME>, but at the least, thou must not let the Prince of Demons loose upon the Prime!~
@878  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, a fellow knight doth require our aid. We must give it!~
@879  = ~An oath? (Saerileth nods solemnly.) Then indeed thou must be rejoiced at the prospect of fulfilling it. An oath once taken cannot be broken.~
@880  = ~You are correct, little girl, but I just want to see this damnable curse ended.~
@881  = ~Thou--Veldrin! Drow features doth suit thine heart! Henceforth thou and my bosom shall be twain!~
@882  = ~As-as the mistress wishes. (His puzzlement is plain.)~
@883  = ~Thou--Veldrin! Drow features doth suit thine heart! Cruel art thou, cruel!~
@884  = ~Irenicus! For my love's sake I strike at thee! For Tyr's justice I stab at thee from the heart of hell!~ [SAERI280]
@885  = ~Now shalt thou fall and trouble my beloved no more!~
@886  = ~Irenicus! Too long hast thou evaded justice! Now shall we strike thee down in Tyr's name!~ [SAERI281]
@887  = ~Tyr hath sent me to follow thee, and I am glad to stand with my friend--even in Hell.~ [SAERI282]
@888  = ~I have followed thee, my love, even into hell, and still farther would I go if thou shouldst call.~ [SAERI283]
@889  = ~Thou art accursed, <CHARNAME>! And I shall smite thee for thine evil!~
@890  = ~HA! A LITTLE CHOSEN ONE? A PROXY? SHE WILL FALL BY YOUR HAND.~
@891  = ~WHAT THEN DO YOU SUGGEST?~
@892  = ~This woman is foul within, <CHARNAME>. Her evil is strong. I shall not follow thee into her service.~
@893  = ~No longer may I journey with thee. That thou wouldst join with so terrible an evil doth speak ill of thine own heart.~
@894  = ~Fare thee well, <CHARNAME>, and may Ilmater have mercy on thy soul.~
@895  = ~Most Royal Majesty, Queen Ellesime. <CHARNAME> and I have plighted our troth and await only a priest of Tyr for the celebration of our nuptials.~ [SAERI293]
@896  = ~Indeed. I had not known this, but I can easily summon for you a priest of Tyr.~
@897  = ~(Saerileth blushes.) Your Majesty hath understood my meaning fully. 'Twas precisely what I had hoped.~
@898  = ~Thank you, Your Majesty.~
@899  = ~And I have longed for this day, as well.~
@900  = ~(Ellesime smiles regally upon both of you.) Then I will have the priest summoned immediately, that you may complete your bridal ceremony before our own celebration.~
@901  = ~(In her joy, Saerileth clasps your hands and kisses them before the gathered Elves.) My beloved, at last our lives shall be one!~
@902  = ~(Saerileth recovers her poise and looks back to the Queen, though your betrothed does not release your hands.) Again, all our thanks, Your Majesty.~
@903  = ~Then let <CHARNAME> recover his strength, and when he is ready, the priest of Tyr will minister to you.~
@904  = ~I will await you both at our celebration, after the conclusion of your bridal ceremony, for I know that such a ceremony would be most private.~
@905  = ~May Corellon Larethian richly bless your union!~
@906  = ~Child, your aura is most difficult. There is a heavenly glow within you, which obscures your future.~
@907  = ~Is't perhaps that I was born on Mount Celestia?~
@908  = ~I could not say. I have little experience with those from other Planes. Regardless, the hand of a god rests heavily on you.~
@909  = ~Thy words are most pleasant, Mistress Kveroslava. I thank thee for thy pains, and may the blessing of Tyr be on thee.~
@910  = ~Oooh, you delicate little blossom. Let me be the first to show you what love with a man is like.~
@911  = ~Let me be the first to introduce you to the pleasures of the bedchamber.~
@912  = ~Let me be your first!~
@913  = ~(Saerileth's face is scarlet.) Sir, thou dost much offend me!~ [SAERI284]
@914  = ~Let me be the first to handle your budding breasts!~
@915  = ~To kiss your cherry lips!~
@916  = ~L-leave me be! (And Saerileth turns away, her shame unbearable.)~
@917  = ~Well, that bitch can go talk face to face with her precious Tyr now! Ha-haaa! <CHARNAME>, let's continue together.~
@918  = ~You're a barrel of laughs, Korgan. Let's go!~
@919  = ~Korgan, you just slaughtered a girl! Get out of my sight!~
@920  = ~Fine with me, you gutless swine! Can't handle a little killing, eh *Bhaalspawn*?~
@921  = ~My companion, Saerileth.~
@922  = ~I'm sick to death of Elves crawling all around this city! Looks like we're going to have to take this town back, block by block!~
@923  = ~I am no Elf, stranger. Waste not thine ire upon me.~
@924  = ~You lie! All Elves are liars!~
@925 = ~(As you are all recovering from the battle with the vampire, you notice Imoen, mischief in her face, approach Saerileth.)~
@926 = ~(Saerileth also notices.) Why do thine eyes rest upon me so, Imoen?~ [SAERI136]
@927 = ~I know how you feel about my brother.~
@928 = ~Aren't you a little young to be having your first crush?~
@929 = ~Then thou knowest not my heart toward thy brother. 'Tis no infatuation.~
@930 = ~(Imoen rolls her eyes, then raises her chin and imitates Saerileth's speech.) 'Tis no mere inflammation of the loins?~
@931 = ~(Saerileth blushes.) Nay, indeed. But I love <CHARNAME> as could no woman of twice my years.~
@932 = ~Oh do you now? (Imoen's teasing suddenly turns serious.)~
@933 = ~And what makes you think you deserve someone like my brother?~
@934 = ~I do not presume to deserve him. (Saerileth does not flinch beneath Imoen's gaze.)~
@935 = ~His love will make up any lack in me, as 'twould do for any woman whom he loved.~
@936 = ~My brother is a dangerous man to know, and an even more dangerous man to love. I hope you will not regret falling in love with a Bhaalspawn.~
@937 = ~The heritage of <CHARNAME> is naught to me. His beauty, which didst pierce mine eyes when I first beheld him, proclaimed to my heart that he was free and unsullied by his father's taint.~
@938 = ~Yeah, he always was a lady-killer...~
@939 = ~What didst thou mean, Imoen, when earlier thou didst say thy brother wast a "lady-killer"?~ [SAERI137]
@940 = ~(Imoen chuckles and shrugs.) Well, you said yourself how good-looking he is. You don't think you're the only girl who's ever fallen for him, do you?~
@941 = ~(Saerileth's face pales.) Aye! I had thought so.~
@942 = ~Don't get so worked up about it, Saerileth. When we were growing up, many of the girls around Candlekeep wrote him love-letters, gave him sweets, and batted their eyes at him.~
@943 = ~But he was just a kid then. He didn't really pay them any mind.~
@944 = ~(Saerileth's face relaxes, though worry remains in her eyes.) I thank thee for this assurance. I am more at ease.~
@945 = ~Yeah, you look it.~
@946 = ~Thou hast broken my heart, <CHARNAME>. What mayest I say? I have loved thee, and thou hast claimed to love me, but thy love is weaker than thine ambition.~
@947 = ~Fare thee well. Never shalt thou see Saerileth more.~
@948 = ~I wast deceived in thee, <CHARNAME>. Thy flowering face doth indeed hide a serpent's heart. I can take no part in this guild of thine.~
@949 = ~Fare thee well. Never shalt thou see Saerileth more.~
@950 = ~Thou dost test me, <CHARNAME>. I can take no part in this guild of thine.~
@951 = ~Fare thee well. Never shalt thou see Saerileth more.~
@952 = ~<CHARNAME>, let not the pleas of a repentant heart go unheeded.~
@953 = ~Aid me, I beg you.~
@954 = ~Then we are akin, though our worlds be as far sundered from each other as each is from this.~
@955 = ~Well met, then. I see you tread a similar path.~
@956 = ~The Abyss? The infernal home of the Tanar'ri! Quickly, let us find a demon heart and leave this plane!~
@957 = ~Stay no longer than is necessary.~
@958 = ~All right, Saerileth. We'll move quickly.~
@959 = ~It's not like you to be so timid. What's wrong?~
@960 = ~Don't worry, Saerileth. I'm not afraid of a few demons.~
@961 = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>, I thank thee. (Saerileth sighs.) But getting this heart will be no small task.~
@962 = ~I am a danger to thee here, <CHARNAME>. If my presence is detected by a demon lord, there will be a heavy reckoning.~
@963 = ~Speed, <CHARNAME>!~
@964 = ~I know that thou art not afeared, but I am a danger to thee here. If my presence is detected by a demon lord, there will be a heavy reckoning.~
@965 = ~<CHARNAME>, thou lecher! (Saerileth turns to the girl.) Thou art yet a maid, art thou not? Wherefore hast thou come to this?~
@966 = ~Thou art no true harlot, art thou?~
@967 = ~Thou shouldst not say such things, <CHARNAME>, not even in jest. To take base advantage of a maid in dire straits doth ill become thee.~
@968 = ~(Saerileth turns to the girl.) Thou art yet a maid, art thou not? Wherefore hast thou come to this? Thou art no true harlot, art thou?~
@969 = ~At last, Sir Anomen, thy waiting, thy courage, thy valor--all, all have been proven! Thou art a knight!~
@970 = ~I am glad for thee.~
@971 = ~Anomen, though thou hast not attained to knighthood, still thou mayest serve Helm.~
@972 = ~Yet thou must beware. Iniquity croucheth at thy door, desiring to have thee, but thou must master it.~
@973 = ~You--you DARE!!! You judge me, you little pampered brat! You have no right, no right at all! You are no different from those other bastards in the Order!~
@974 = ~I will smash your face in for that!~
@975 = ~Now at least her wagging tongue is forever stilled!~
@976 = ~That's for sure! Now let's go, Anomen--but don't forget to pillage the body!~
@977 = ~You bastard! You killed her! Get out of my sight.~
@978 = ~You killed my Saerileth! You heartless bastard! Go, and if ever we meet again, that hour is your last!~
@979 = ~I wouldn't sully myself with YOUR company!~
@980 = ~Ha! Couldn't protect your little bitch, could you? You probably can't even defend yourself! Die, weakling!~
@981 = ~Indeed. Your mining hadst awoken a mighty demon. Have a care how deeply thou and thy people do delve hereafter.~
@982 = ~I thank you, truly, for what you have done. Our danger was even greater than what we had thought.~
@983 = ~This poor child! To be murdered by a burglar! <CHARNAME>, we must aid the child and bring the murderer to justice!~
@984 = ~I just want Littleman! Can you please help me?~
@985 = ~<CHARNAME>, thou art cruel and unjust! How canst thou refuse to aid this suffering child? 'Tis within thy power.~
@986 = ~I...I can't go to sleep without Littleman! I'm so tired! Please help me, <SIRMAAM>.~
@987 = ~Why canst thou not aid this suffering child who wast cruelly murdered in his bed? <CHARNAME>, rethink thy decision!~
@988 = ~Rest. Rest, perturbed spirit. Today thou shalt be in paradise.~
@989 = ~Thank you!~
@990 = ~<CHARNAME>, I will no part of this! Thou art no better than the murderer!~
@991 = ~I *will* have Littleman!~
@992 = ~<CHARNAME>, confront this monster! Do not shirk thy duty!~
@993 = ~I ain't no monster. Just tryin' to enjoy some peace and quiet! If yer gonna go yellin', do it in the common room!~
@994 = ~Oh, a very devil! Hell hath not punishment sufficient for thee!~
@995 = ~Get outta here, and leave me alone!~
@996 = ~<CHARNAME>! Thou hast spared his life? Thou hast set free a known murderer! 'Tis unconscionable!~
@997 = ~(The thief flees.)~
@998 = ~Justice findeth thee this day, murderer! Wellyn's soul doth cry out for it!~
@999 = ~Die, all of you!~
@1000 = ~This city is a horrible place, <CHARNAME>. Such hatred; such treachery. That a daughter wouldst betray her mother, even to her death!~
@1001 = ~Heavens defend us! <CHARNAME>, this place is a sinkhole of evil! Let us away!~
@1002 = ~Saerileth, it's not like you to run away. Shouldn't we stay to face the evil?~
@1003 = ~Yeah, this place gives me the creeps.  Let's go.~
@1004 = ~I, too, sense a grave evil here. Let us tarry here no longer.~
@1005 = ~What do you mean? I sense nothing.~
@1006 = ~Don't be so squeamish. I want to check out this altar.~
@1007 = ~The gods have given this place over! Tyr's Chosen can do nothing here. It doth belong to the Prince of Demons.~
@1008 = ~But I want to get the promised reward!~
@1009 = ~Is there nothing we can do?~
@1010 = ~You're right. Let's leave.~
@1011 = ~With all speed, <CHARNAME>! (Saerileth turns to go, but her eyes widen and her jaw sets as she slowly turns back.)~
@1012 = ~Too late. They come. For Tyr!~
@1013 = ~The very air here doth breathe evil. The gods have given this place over!~
@1014 = ~Tyr's Chosen can do nothing here. It doth belong to the Prince of Demons.~
@1015 = ~Nay, do not, <CHARNAME>! 'Tis a thing of absolute evil and is anathema to Tyr.~
@1016 = ~If thou dost consort with Demogorgon, no more shall I journey with thee.~
@1017 = ~Don't threaten me, Saerileth! I will do what I wish!~
@1018 = ~I have no wish to consort with Demogorgon, but the reward interests me.~
@1019 = ~Fine, Saerileth. Let's just leave then.~
@1020 = ~Let not thyself be tempted by evil's allurements! <CHARNAME>, I beg thee! Approach not the altar!~
@1021 = ~I'm staying, and that's it! I have *got* to see what Demogorgon is offering.~
@1022 = ~Nay, as I have told thee: this place hath been given over to Demogorgon. 'Twould be easier to destroy his avatar than to make this place wholesome again.~
@1023 = ~<CHARNAME>, enough talk! I feel a dread presence approaching. We must be gone!~
@1024 = ~Then let us waste no more time in leaving.~
@1025 = ~Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee, servant of the Enemy!~
@1026 = ~Hold, <CHARNAME>, and do not approach this woman! There is such black evil in her as I have rarely seen.~
@1027 = ~Behold, <CHARNAME>! This sword is the very work of Hell's forge! Beware, and wield it not.~
@1028 = ~<CHARNAME>, wherefore hast thou done this? Thou hast betrayed the trust of Trademeet and hast poisoned the land!~
@1029 = ~Thy deeds are dark, and I cannot continue in thy company.~
@1030 = ~Indeed, this is the end... for thee! Tyr's judgement upon thy foul deeds!~
@1031 = ~Your skin will be the *first* I take, little girl!~
@1032 = ~Horrible! That such a man didst walk the earth! Evil cannot be content with its own form but must ever find new depths of depravity.~
@1033 = ~Perhaps Mistress Jaheira can instruct us on what is best to be done.~
@1034 = ~Aye, 'tis a wise course, High Merchant. Mob "justice" is seldom just.~
@1035 = ~<CHARNAME>, wherefore hast thou slaughtered this man? What wrong hath he done?~
@1036 = ~Ask Minsc! He is a murdering Thayvian wizard who wanted to kill Minsc's witch!~
@1037 = ~I've known Edwin for a long time. He was a black-hearted murderer with nothing but contempt for others.~
@1038 = ~This wizard worked for a thieves' guild. He deserved to die!~
@1039 = ~No real reason, really. I figured I might as well do it as not. After all, he worked for a thieves' guild.~
@1040 = ~He was a warm body to kill, and you know I cannot resist randomly slaughtering those whom I do not know!~
@1041 = ~Then I am sorry for thee, Minsc. Justice hath been served upon the one who sought to do thee such wrong.~
@1042 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I meant not to question thy judgement.~
@1043 = ~But thou didst not take the time to discover the particulars of his situation. Thou hast exacted a bloody, hasty judgement upon him.~
@1044 = ~I don't have time to get to know him, Saerileth. His being here was reason enough for me to kill him.~
@1045 = ~Perhaps I was hasty, but it's just that Edwin has a reputation for evil. He is a Thayvian wizard, belonging to a conclave of mages known throughout the Realms for their evil!~
@1046 = ~I did not know this, nor did I think it of thee. I see now that I was mistaken.~
@1047 = ~Thy flowering face didst deceive mine eyes, but now I perceive thy black heart! (And Saerileth turns her countenance away from you.)~
@1048 = ~Boo and I are glad that the evil wizard is dead! We have wanted to punish him for trying to kill Dynaheir!~
@1049 = ~Goodness required that we kick his butt!~
@1050 = ~(Saerileth smiles at the large ranger and pats his hand.) And thou hast meted out justice, Minsc, rest thou assured.~
@1051 = ~(Saerileth starts towards the demon, a desperate fury burning in her eyes, but she stops and turns to you, silently awaiting your decision.)~
@1052 = ~(The demon smiles cruelly at Saerileth then turns back to you.) Well?~
@1053 = ~Thou hast given thyself of thine own free will to succubi demons! Thy heart and mine shall henceforth be twain.~
@1054 = ~Saerileth! What are you doing?~
@1055 = ~<CHARNAME>! Ah, I knew that thou wouldst come for me! Mine only love!~ [SAERI163]
@1056 = ~I couldn't leave you for the devils, Saerileth, but I have no need of you any longer.~
@1057 = ~My beloved! Of course I would come for you. I could not live without you!~
@1058 = ~I did not know how much I loved you until you were taken from me, Saerileth.~
@1059 = ~Let's get out of here!~
@1060 = ~What? Thou wouldst leave me after all of this?~
@1061 = ~You can go with Edorem.~
@1062 = ~On second thought, I do need you.~
@1063 = ~As thou wouldst have it, my love. I shall ever treasure thee in my heart.~
@1064 = ~Thou much affrighted me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1065 = ~Nor I without you. (Saerileth kisses your cheek.) I thank thee, beloved.~
@1066 = ~And now let us return back to thy home.~
@1067 = ~Oh my heart is too full of joy! Thou hast given me life and with it thy love!~
@1068 = ~(Saerileth kisses your hand.) Beloved <CHARNAME>. But we must rejoice later. There is much to be said, but for now let us return to thy home.~
@1069 = ~As ever, thou speak'st aright. Let us go.~
@1070 = ~<CHARNAME>! Lord Edorem! (Saerileth's face is full of joy, and her cobalt eyes fix on the knight's for a long moment before she turns back to you.)~
@1071 = ~Thou hast mine eternal gratitude, <CHARNAME>. But come, let us leave this place.~ [SAERI164]
@1072 = ~I couldn't leave you for the devils, Saerileth, but I have no need of you any longer.~
@1073 = ~Right. Let's get out of here!~
@1074 = ~Thou art kind, <CHARNAME>, and if thou dost refuse me thy company, Tyr wilt direct me into another path.~
@1075 = ~I am grateful to thee, <CHARNAME>. Tyr's will is that I yet journey with thee.~
@1076 = ~(Saerileth's gaze is fixed on Edorem's face as she speaks, despite the fact that she is addressing you.)~
@1077 = ~Thou speak'st aright. Let us go. (Her eyes still linger on Edorem's face as she speaks.)~
@1078 = ~<CHARNAME>! Wherefore art thou wantonly cruel to this child?~
@1079 = ~(Saerileth turns to the child.) Fear not, little one, for there are those in this city who wilt care for thee. Get thee to the Temple of Ilmater, in the Promenade.~
@1080 = ~Oh, thank you so much, miss!~
@1081 = ~<CHARNAME>, we must give the child more substantial aid than a single piece of gold.~
@1082 = ~Thank you, <SIRMAAM>. The priests here are really nice. They're going to help me find a new place to live.~
@1083 = ~I will not carry this thing of evil, <CHARNAME>, nor art thou wise to take it with us!~
@1084 = ~Let this abominable skin of evil come not near me!~
@1085 = ~<CHARNAME>, I will have nothing to do with this iniquitous blade. Take it.~
@1086 = ~Does that mean you will help us?~
@1087 = ~<CHARNAME>, is't for me?~
@1088 = ~Yes, Saerileth. I want you to have it. The lady said it will never wither or fade.~
@1089 = ~Yes, Saerileth. I want you to remember that I love you, that I am jealous of your attentions, and that I must have you all to myself.~
@1090 = ~Yes, Saerileth. Let this flower be a symbol of me always being between you and Edorem.~
@1091 = ~Oh, mine own <CHARNAME>. I love thee truly! I will cherish this blossom, this eternal symbol of our love, and keep it with me always.~
@1092 = ~All to thyself? (Saerileth laughs and kisses your hand.) Ah, beloved of my heart!~
@1093 = ~I am ever only thine own. There is none who couldst ever take my heart from thee.~
@1094 = ~(Saerileth touches the adder's tongue to her lips.) I do thank thee, truly, for thy gift. I shall ever treasure it as a symbol of our love.~
@1095 = ~Lord Edorem? (Saerileth flushes rosily.) Ah, mine own <CHARNAME>, there is no need for thee to be jealous of him.~
@1096 = ~He is as my brother, a Chosen of Tyr and my superior in the Order, but no more than this.~
@1097 = ~Yes, Saerileth. It shows that you are a beauty, and I am flattered by your love.~
@1098 = ~It is for you, a rare blossom for a rare maiden.~
@1099 = ~Ah, my beloved, there is no flattery in my love for thee, nor is there need of it in love such as ours.~
@1100 = ~(Saerileth smiles and gently traces the delicate black petals.) 'Tis beautiful. I shall ever cherish it, my <CHARNAME>.~
@1101 = ~'Tis beautiful, my love. (Saerileth smiles and gently traces the delicate black petals.) I shall ever cherish it.~
@1102 = ~I do thank thee, <CHARNAME>, truly, and I shall ever cherish this thy gift.~
@1103 = ~Yes, Saerileth. It symbolizes your maiden modesty and your beauty.~
@1104 = ~Yes, Saerileth, it is for you, though its purity and beauty are but a poor reflection of your own.~
@1105 = ~(Saerileth smiles sweetly.) Beloved, thou hast brought a maiden blush to my cheeks with thy kindness and thy sweetness.~
@1106 = ~I shall ever treasure this calla lily, as a symbol of thee and of our love.~
@1107 = ~Nay, not me, <CHARNAME>, but aye, our love, pure and unspotted as this blossom, shall ever be true.~
@1108 = ~I thank thee, beloved, truly.~
@1109 = ~Yes, take it. It is the picture of my fidelity in love.~
@1110 = ~Yes, Saerileth, it is for you. May our love ever be faithful.~
@1111 = ~Thy fidelity? Ah, mine own, I didst not ever doubt thee! (Saerileth throws her arms around you, nearly causing the carnation to slip to the ground.)~
@1112 = ~Truly, I thank thee. I will ever treasure this thy gift.~
@1113 = ~(Saerileth solemnly takes the carnation from you.) Aye, be it so.~
@1114 = ~(The moment is too serious for more words, but you catch Saerileth touching her lips to the petals.)~
@1115 = ~Yes, Saerileth. It is an innocent flower for the innocent maiden whom I love.~
@1116 = ~It is like you, Saerileth. Take it, as my gift.~
@1117 = ~(Saerileth smiles sweetly, flushing up to the roots of her hair.) I thank thee, truly.~
@1118 = ~I will ever cherish this thy gift, for it doth symbolize our love, which is yet more innocent than I.~
@1119 = ~Thou art too kind to me, <CHARNAME>! (Saerileth's joy at your gift is unbounded.)~
@1120 = ~I shall ever treasure this symbol of our love.~
@1121 = ~It is the color of your eyes, Saerileth, and I knew I had to have it for you.~
@1122 = ~It means constancy and true love, Saerileth, so it is the perfect blossom for you.~
@1123 = ~(Saerileth blushes at your simple compliment.) <CHARNAME>, thou art too, too good to me!~
@1124 = ~I shall treasure it always, beloved. To know that I am lovely in thine eyes is ever joy to me.~
@1125 = ~Constancy and true love? Then, aye, my <CHARNAME>, without pride I may say that this is truly mine own blossom.~
@1126 = ~For ever, ever shall I love thee!~
@1127 = ~Yes, it is, for your love flatters me, my lovely Saerileth.~
@1128 = ~Yes, it's for you. I wanted to flatter your beauty, but I can't. You are too beautiful for that.~
@1129 = ~Nay, my love. I flatter thee not, for thou art more than worthy. Nor would I be flattered by thee.~
@1130 = ~Truth only walks the path between two loving hearts. But for thy gift--lovely and precious--I thank thee.~
@1131 = ~I will ever treasure this blossom as the eternal symbol of our love.~
@1132 = ~In thine eyes only, my <CHARNAME>, am I so lovely as that. (Saerileth smiles, her face shining as she takes the orchid from you.)~
@1133 = ~Ever will I cherish it.~
@1134 = ~Yes, it is, Saerileth. It symbolizes the secret love I bear for you.~
@1135 = ~It means that our love must remain secret.~
@1136 = ~Secret love? (Saerileth laughs.) Ah, mine own, thou art ever merry! How canst our love be secret when thy very gift doth proclaim it?~
@1137 = ~(Saerileth's eyes dance as she takes the pink rose from you.) Ever will I cherish this thy gift.~
@1138 = ~Wherefore shouldst our love be secret, <CHARNAME>? (Saerileth's eyes well with tears, and she looks down at the rose she holds.)~
@1139 = ~Art thou ashamed of me?~
@1140 = ~No, of course not, Saerileth. I'm just worried that being my love puts you in danger.~
@1141 = ~Not really, but I am a bit embarrassed by your age.~
@1142 = ~Beloved, fear thou not for me. I wouldst suffer more in being sundered from thee than in any danger that I mayst encounter by thy side.~
@1143 = ~And for this thy gift, I thank thee. (She touches the pink rose to her lips.) Ever will I cherish it as the symbol of thy care for me.~
@1144 = ~(Saerileth's face drains of color, but she does not drop the rose.) Forgive me, <CHARNAME>.~
@1145 = ~I knew not that I was a source of shame to thee. I will ever keep this rose as a remembrance of the pain I cause to the one I love.~
@1146 = ~(And Saerileth resumes her place in formation, sorrowfully looking again and again at your gift.)~
@1147 = ~Yes, Saerileth. It is the flower of love, and you are my love.~
@1148 = ~Yes, for it is the flower of lovers, and you are my only love.~
@1149 = ~(Saerileth bows her head over the rose, touching her lips to the blood-colored petals.)~
@1150 = ~As thou art mine, <CHARNAME>, heart of my heart. I thank thee, truly, and I shall ever prize this thy gift as I would mine honor.~
@1151 = ~Then all mine highest ambition is fulfilled, for I have no other wish than to be thine.~
@1152 = ~I thank thee, truly, and I shall ever prize this thy gift as I would mine honor.~
@1153 = ~Yes, Saerileth, for the violet is the flower of faithfulness, of love, of loyalty--of you.~
@1154 = ~It is the symbol of the faith and loyalty of our love, Saerileth, and it is for you.~
@1155 = ~(Suddenly Saerileth looks up at you.) How didst thou know that the violet is the flower of all others that I love? Never have I told thee of it.~
@1156 = ~But I shouldst not be surprised at thy knowledge of me, for our hearts are one.~
@1157 = ~Thou art too kind to me, beloved, but ever shall I strive to be worthy of thy love.~
@1158 = ~Oh, beloved! I thank thee, truly.  My love and loyalty, all my faith, are thine and thine alone.~
@1159 = ~It is the outward symbol of the purity of your heart, Saerileth, and it is yours.~
@1160 = ~Yes, my Saerileth. It is yours, the only gift I could find as spotless and pure as you are.~
@1161 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>. (Saerileth's words are barely a breath.)~
@1162 = ~'Tis lovely, and I shall ever strive to be worthy of it--and of thy love.~
@1163 = ~(Saerileth blushes becomingly.) I am not divine as thou art, my love, but I shall strive ever to be worthy of this thy gift.~
@1164 = ~And of thy love.~
@1165 = ~Yes, beloved. It is sweet and pure, like you.~
@1166 = ~It is an image, poor, but the best I could find, of your sweetness and purity.~
@1167 = ~I love thee, <CHARNAME>, and thou art good to me! I will ever treasure this lily and strive to be as good in truth as I am in thine eyes.~
@1168 = ~(Saerileth can find no words, but she covers your hands with kisses.)~
@1169 = ~(You notice her eyes resting often on the white softness of the lily, and she smiles.)~
@1170 = ~Yes, for it shows that I am worthy of your love, that we are truly matched.~
@1171 = ~My Lady, it honors our innocent love, and, I hope, shows the worth of my affections.~
@1172 = ~Thou art far more than worthy of my love, sweet <CHARNAME>. Forgive my too halting tongue that cannot tell half my love.~
@1173 = ~I do thank thee for thy gift, and I shall ever cherish it.~
@1174 = ~Thine affections are beyond my deserving, beloved <CHARNAME>, and I do thank thee that thou hast bestowed them on me.~
@1175 = ~(Saerileth blushes.) This rose shall ever serve to remind me of thy humility.~
@1176 = ~'Tis a holy blade, <CHARNAME>, and I am honored that thou hast entrusted its care to me.~
@1177 = ~Saerileth, I think I'm in love with you.~
@1178 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am sorry for thee, but my heart is not thine.~
@1179 = ~I am thy true and constant friend, but no more than this can I be to thee.~
@1180 = ~Why can you not love me? You haven't even given me a chance!~
@1181 = ~Why are you so set against me without even trying to love me?~
@1182 = ~Perhaps time will change your mind.~
@1183 = ~My heart is not mine own to give. Another doth hold it.~
@1184 = ~So you are spoken for...~
@1185 = ~Saerileth, I am in agony! Can you not be persuaded?~
@1186 = ~Saerileth, I love you too much to walk beside you as a friend. Your presence here only reminds me of my pain.~
@1187 = ~That is not possible. My heart is not mine own to give. Another doth hold it.~
@1188 = ~Aye, for mine own part. Whether my love will accept me, I know not, but my heart cannot return to me.~
@1189 = ~Very well, Saerileth. But know that I love you, and that I will wait for you.~
@1190 = ~I will not be second place to any man! Saerileth, I fear my jealousy will drive me to violence!~
@1191 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I cannot love thee, nor wouldst thou desire the love of one so changeable as I would be if I didst love thee.~
@1192 = ~Then I will leave thee, <CHARNAME>, and trouble thee no more. I am sorry for thee, truly. I wish thee well.~
@1193 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, do not do so. Find another to love.~
@1194 = ~Peace, <CHARNAME>. Thou hast no cause for jealousy, for I was never thine.~
@1195 = ~Can we not be as we were before?~
@1196 = ~If your friendship is all I can have, then I must be content with that.~
@1197 = ~And my friendship thou shalt ever have.~
@1198 = ~Behold, <CHARNAME>. A knight of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart doth approach.~
@1199 = ~Let us return to Sir Clarenshide and tell him of our victory.~
@1200 = ~Indeed, they are.~
@1201 = ~You watch yourself in here, missy. We'll have no interference with business.~
@1202 = ~Yes, and it has been a long time coming.~
@1203 = ~What are you speaking of?~
@1204 = ~(Lady Delcia snorts derisively.)~
@1205 = ~<CHARNAME> can make up his own mind.~
@1206 = ~Fiend of a fiendish Order!~
@1207 = ~Now, now, little paladin. Let's not bring hell into our discussion.~
@1208 = ~Surfacer prejudice never fails to sicken me!~
@1209 = ~I am glad someone sees my plight as it truly is.~
@1210 = ~<CHARNAME>! Thou hast murdered an honorable man! Thy deed is black, and I can no longer abide thine evil. May Tyr's justice fall heavily upon thee.~
@1211 = ~<CHARNAME>! Why hast thou done this? Thou hast murdered an honorable man! Why do dark deeds crouch in thy seemingly pure heart?~
@1212 = ~Thou hast broken my heart, <CHARNAME>. May Tyr's justice fall heavily upon thee.~
@1213 = ~Why hast thou given this wicked blade into my possession? Dost thou tempt me?~
@1214 = ~I shall not abide its presence any more. Tyr, undo this work of evil!~
@1215 = ~I wast deceived in thee, <CHARNAME>, and in thine affection for me. To thee, I am no more than a common harlot.~
@1216 = ~A common stale is all that thou dost deserve! Saerileth is not for thee!~
@1217 = ~Even your beauty is not worth getting on the bad side of a Bhaalspawn. Goodbye.~
@1218 = ~<CHARNAME>, art thou well? Canst thou stand?~
@1219 = ~I am fine. Thank you for your concern, Saerileth.~
@1220 = ~I'm not sure what Irenicus did to me. I feel a strange hollowness inside.~
@1221 = ~Thou art most welcome, <CHARNAME>, but know that thou dost truly seem very ill. If there is aught I can do, please tell me.~
@1222 = ~Lean on me, then, <CHARNAME>, if thou wilt. I wouldst aid thee if I can.~
@1223 = ~My beloved, lean on me. Thy face is pale and thy breath doth come too quickly.~
@1224 = ~It's nothing, my love. It will soon pass.~
@1225 = ~Saerileth, what is this present dread I feel? What is this darkness that has been thrown like a veil over the world?~
@1226 = ~Thy courage is undoubted, mine own, but thou hast suffered untold horrors. 'Twould be well to rest a while.~
@1227 = ~Ah, my love. Tyr protect thee! Take my hand, and I will lead thee till the darkness hath passed.~
@1228 = ~Tell me something of your mother, Saerileth.~
@1229 = ~My mother, Lirana, is a follower of the Three, but she doth, as a Painbearer, serve most Ilmater.~
@1230 = ~I didn't know your mother was a cleric.~
@1231 = ~She doesn't serve Tyr?~
@1232 = ~What does she look like?~
@1233 = ~Aye, she is. My father doth follow Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater, but he is a wizard. My mother hath worn the scarlet and grey for so long as I can recall.~
@1234 = ~The scarlet and grey?~
@1235 = ~How did your father come to meet your mother?~
@1236 = ~What does your mother look like? Do you look like her?~
@1237 = ~Scarlet and grey are the colors of the priesthood of the Crying God.~
@1238 = ~I have few memories of my mother, but perhaps the clearest is the day she came to the temple of Tyr for the celebration of my seventh year there.~
@1239 = ~So you were twelve?~
@1240 = ~When you turned seven?~
@1241 = ~My grandsire didst desire to bind our line to that of his dear friend. To that end, he didst arrange for his son to wed the daughter of his friend.~
@1242 = ~My father didst first see my mother on the day he took her to wife.~
@1243 = ~How old was she then?~
@1244 = ~Are they happy?~
@1245 = ~So your parents' was not a love match?~
@1246 = ~My mother is most lovely, but I am not like her. She is not eladrin-touched, and thus her face and form are both fully human.~
@1247 = ~She hath hair like to thy golden sun, and her eyes are green. She is tall and fair, altogether lovely.~
@1248 = ~I hope I can meet her someday.~
@1249 = ~I never knew my mother. Gorion was a father to me, but I had no mother.~
@1250 = ~Aye, I was twelve. My mother and father had both come to the celebration, but there suddenly arrived a contingent of archon warriors from a skirmish in the Abyss.~
@1251 = ~The healing of the priests was greatly taxed, and my mother aided them.~
@1252 = ~I do yet see her so, her hair flowing loose from under her small, grey cap, her scarlet gown daubed with fresh blood, and her tireless patience as she moved amongst the injured.~
@1253 = ~I have scarce seen her since then, but I shall never forget.~
@1254 = ~Nay, I didst mean when I had been seven years at the temple. My mother and father had both come to the celebration, but there suddenly arrived a contingent of archon warriors from a skirmish in the Abyss.~
@1255 = ~She was fifteen.~
@1256 = ~(Saerileth smiles brightly, but she speaks no more.)~
@1257 = ~Aye. Wherefore shouldst they not be? They have chosen each to love th'other.~
@1258 = ~(Saerileth smiles sweetly, but she speaks no more.)~
@1259 = ~Nay, not in that their love didst come before their marriage. But they have chosen each to love th' other.~
@1260 = ~I wouldst be proud and glad for her to meet thee, beloved. I do hope it may'st be soon.~
@1261 = ~For that I do pity thee, mine own. I have not dwelt with my mother since I was five years old, but I have seen her and known her love.~
@1262 = ~Thou, too, shalt have a mother, therefore, in her.~
@1263 = ~She doth honor Tyr, perforce. Ilmater the Crying God himself doth pay homage to Blind Tyr.~
@1264 = ~Still, my mother hath worn the scarlet and grey for so long as I can recall.~
@1265 = ~(Tickle Saerileth.)~
@1266 = ~Saerileth, you have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen.~
@1267 = ~Will you wear that one outfit for me? You know the one...~
@1268 = ~Saerileth, I dream of a universe where your eyes are the stars, and everyone worships the night.~
@1269 = ~Give me my <CHARNAME>, and when I shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.~
@1270 = ~Mine eyes do shine for thee alone, mine own.~
@1271 = ~Nay, my love, thou art mistaken, for thou hast forgotten thine own eyes.~
@1272 = ~<CHARNAME>, thy praises do bring the wanton blood to my cheeks.~
@1273 = ~(Saerileth catches your hands and imprisons them in her own.) Thou art playful, my love.~
@1274 = ~(Saerileth wriggles away.) No, not *there*, <CHARNAME>!~
@1275 = ~(Saerileth laughs and deftly ducks behind you, tickling you in return.) I have escaped thee, <CHARNAME>, and now thou art at *my* mercy!~
@1276 = ~Thy light heart is ever a joy to me, beloved--nay, no more! (And Saerileth collapses in laughter.)~
@1277 = ~<CHARNAME>, art thou truly well?~
@1278 = ~What makes you ask, Saerileth?~
@1279 = ~Yes, I am, but I don't think *you* are, dearest.~
@1280 = ~Yes, I am, but I'm not so sure about *you*.~
@1281 = ~This whole dragon battle has left me a bit dazed, I admit.~
@1282 = ~It isn't every day you kill a great wyrm. Maybe I'm just a bit shocked.~
@1283 = ~There are but few enemies to compare with a mighty wyrm. I seek only to comfort thee.~
@1284 = ~My darling, I need no comfort. I am simply glad we are alive.~
@1285 = ~Why would I need comfort? I'm glad we're alive!~
@1286 = ~I am shaken, I confess. But we are victorious.~
@1287 = ~Since I left Candlekeep I've done nothing but fight. I should've known I'd face a dragon before the end.~
@1288 = ~As am I, beloved. I feared for thee, more even than is my wont.~
@1289 = ~The wyrm wast a terrible evil, and I am proud thou heldest me worthy to have stood with thee against it.~
@1290 = ~Dearest, you were brave enough to face it. That makes you worthy.~
@1291 = ~I would have preferred to leave you in safety, my love, but I needed your strength.~
@1292 = ~I, too, am glad. 'Tis not, perhaps, my place to say so, but, <CHARNAME>, I am honored that thou didst think me worthy to stand with thee against the wyrm.~
@1293 = ~It wasn't a question of worth, Saerileth. You were willing. That was enough.~
@1294 = ~If I could, I would have left you somewhere safer.~
@1295 = ~Aye, thanks be to Tyr! I must confess that in the battle with the wyrm I didst fear for thy safety.~
@1296 = ~And yet the battle couldst not be shirked. Such an evil--yet I thank thee that thou foundest me worthy to fight by thy side.~
@1297 = ~True, <CHARNAME>. Thy life hath been naught but war since thou wast cast from the home of thy youth.~
@1298 = ~I do ever give thanks to Wounded Tyr that I have been accounted worthy of the honor to fight by thy side.~
@1299 = ~Thou didst grant me worth through thy love.~
@1300 = ~And even for that do I love thee the more.~
@1301 = ~Thy loving care of me doth ever give me strength, beloved, and that strength is thine under Tyr.~
@1302 = ~I am willing ever to follow thee, <CHARNAME>.~
@1303 = ~Thy care of me is true, <CHARNAME>.~
@1304 = ~(Saerileth turns away suddenly, overcome.)~
@1305 = ~I am well, beloved. I didst merely seek to comfort thee, for there are but few foes to compare with a mighty wyrm.~
@1306 = ~I am well. 'Twas kind of thee to inquire. (Saerileth blushes.)~
@1307 = ~I didst merely seek to comfort thee, for there are but few foes to compare with a mighty wyrm.~
@1308 = ~Is there aught I can do to aid or comfort thee?~
@1309 = ~I need nothing. We are victorious.~
@1310 = ~I need the touch of your hand, my love.~
@1311 = ~It is enough to have my companions with me.~
@1312 = ~This battle has made me realize what is truly important--you. I love you, Saerileth.~
@1313 = ~Kiss me, Saerileth. I need to feel alive.~
@1314 = ~Of course, mine own. The feel of thy hand on mine doth brush every ill memory from my mind.~
@1315 = ~(Saerileth takes your hand and does not release it.)~
@1316 = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>, and there are those amongst thy companions who wouldst gladly follow thee into the Abyss if thou didst wish it.~
@1317 = ~<CHARNAME>! Oh, 'tis too much of joy!~
@1318 = ~(Saerileth takes one of your hands in both of hers and drops kisses upon it like rain.)~
@1319 = ~My love and life! My tongue doth fail me, but my life shall be devoted to thee, my love.~
@1320 = ~(Saerileth silently presses her lips to yours.)~
@1321 = ~Thou livest, and I do live for thee, under Tyr.~
@1322 = ~Would you mind if I called you Saeri?~
@1323 = ~What's new, pussycat?~
@1324 = ~Saerileth, you are my Angel of Light.~
@1325 = ~Lady Ravenlocks, I love you!~
@1326 = ~Call me but Love, and I will be new baptized. If Saeri doth please thee, then Saeri I am.~
@1327 = ~Pussycat? <CHARNAME>, art thou attempting to give me a pet name?~
@1328 = ~Nay, my love. I am but a mirror for thine own brightness.~
@1329 = ~And I thee, my Prince!~
@1330 = ~Couldn't be better!~
@1331 = ~I am glad for thee, then, <CHARNAME>. Thy strength is admirable.~
@1332 = ~Saerileth, if Mount Celestia were an oyster, you would be its pearl.~
@1333 = ~Wilt thou construct metaphors for me, then?~
@1334 = ~I would do anything for you!~
@1335 = ~I would learn any craft that might better express my love.~
@1336 = ~Then do but love me, for it is all that I require.~
@1337 = ~Thine eyes already do express all that I need know, yet still to hear thee speak it is sweet.~
@1338 = ~I thank thee, Sir Keldorn, for thy care of me, but thou hast no need to tell me. I have overheard the faithlessness of the one I loved.~
@1339 = ~I gavest thee my heart in truth and didst think that I stood with thee on a footing of equal honor. But thou hast lied and trodden upon my gift to thee.~
@1340 = ~No more shall I be thine.~
@1341 = ~When that we didst look upon the avatar and very form of the Prince of Demons, I didst not fear mine own death--but yet I wast certain of it. Holy Tyr hath shielded us indeed!~
@1342 = ~To attack mine enemies from a distance doth not accord with the commands of Tyr to me. I must meet my foes face to face.~
@1343 = ~Thou art a simple bandit, <CHARNAME>, and no more. I give thee mercy in not striking thee now, but no more may I sully myself in thy company.~
@1344 = ~And now, <CHARNAME>, my long sojourn by thy side may'st end. Thy cruelty I have not forgotten, and now that my duty to Wounded Tyr be discharged, I shall leave thee.~
@1345 = ~Never shalt thou see Saerileth more.~
@1346 = ~Yet the dreadful countenance of Demogorgon is burnt into mine eyes. I do fear that never shall I be rid of it.~
@1347 = ~<CHARNAME>! What is this? It doth seem that Blind Tyr hath blessed me with his favor in the form of these gifts!~
@1348 = ~Mayhap these tomes do contain a message from the Maimed God. Let us look and see!~
@1349 = ~This ring is evil, <CHARNAME>! I shall not suffer its touch, nor will I even carry it.~
@1350 = ~I render it back to thee. Let it come not near me again!~
@1351 = ~That thou givest me this ring once more doth tell me thou wouldst have it destroyed by the light of Wounded Tyr.~
@1352 = ~May he grant his Chosen the strength to do it!~

@5002 = ~Saerileth Abducted

Saerileth has been abducted by a mighty devil-lord. We have joined forces with a knight of Tyr to try to rescue her. First we must seek out Jharak in the city of Sigil, to obtain from him the Scepter of Tyr.~

@5003 = ~Saerileth Abducted

Saerileth has been abducted by a mighty devil-lord. We have joined forces with a knight of Tyr to try to rescue her. We are to set off for Baator immediately.~

@5004 = ~Saerileth Abducted

Saerileth has been abducted by a mighty devil-lord. It is too dangerous to try to rescue her. We have left her to her fate.~

We have found Jharak, but he has sent us to fetch a portal before he will tell us the location of the Scepter of Tyr.~

We have found Kesevar the Fallen, but he claims that his punishment is undeserved. He has sent in search of the only witness who can testify to his innocence: a Bhaalspawn by the name of Gunshain.~

@5012 = ~The Fallen Deva

Gunshain, as it turns out, did clear Kesevar's name, but he also tried to kill us! We have dispatched him, and we must return to Kesevar quickly.~

@5013 = ~The Fallen Deva

Saerileth has pronounced Kesevar innocent, and her proclamation has taken immediate effect. The deva is restored to his former glory, and Saerileth remains in my company.~

@5014 = ~The Fallen Deva

It seems that Kesevar was not guilty after all. For destroying him, Saerileth has lost the grace of Tyr. My love has gone back to the Planes to try to atone for her failure. I will never see her again.~

@5015 = ~The Fallen Deva

It seems that Kesevar was not guilty after all. For destroying him, Saerileth has lost the grace of Tyr. The young paladin has gone back to the Planes to try to atone for her failure. I will never see her again.~

@5016 = ~Delilah the Harlot

A man in Amkethran is proclaiming that Delilah, whom he claims to be the most beautiful woman in these lands, is selling the pleasures of her bed in the Inn here. My wife, Saerileth, and I have grave misgivings about the fate of the men who went to see her.~

@5017 = ~Delilah the Harlot

A man in Amkethran is proclaiming that Delilah, whom he claims to be the most beautiful woman in these lands, is selling the pleasures of her bed in the Inn here. I have grave misgivings about the fate of the men who went to see her.~

@5018 = ~Delilah the Harlot

I succumbed to the charms of Delilah, only to discover that she is a succubus! My adultery broke Saerileth's heart, and she is dead. The succubus has returned to the Abyss, and I am less than the man I was before.~

@5019 = ~Delilah the Harlot

I succumbed to the charms of Delilah, only to discover that she is a succubus! The succubus has returned to the Abyss, and I am less than the man I was before.~

@5020 = ~Delilah the Harlot

Saerileth has assured me that this Delilah is a demon, but we cannot slay her without damning the men who are with her. We must find a temple where we may be able to find aid in piercing demonic illusions.~

@5021 = ~Delilah the Harlot

I have refused to help those lechers caught in the embrace of the demons. They brought their fate upon themselves. Saerileth is saddened, but she agrees that their punishment is just.~

@5022 = ~Delilah the Harlot

I have received from the priest of Waukeen a scroll which has the ability to cancel illusions. Whether its power will work against the magicks of hell is yet to be seen.~

@5023 = ~Delilah the Harlot

The magic of the scroll was successful. Whether it was the scroll itself or the prayers of Saerileth, I do not know for sure. Nevertheless, it worked, and the demons were forced to abandon their plans and return to the Abyss.~

@5024 = ~Defeating Khalabaxin

I have accepted Sir Havun Clarenshide's request for aid against the dragon Khalabaxin. I will find him near his newly-acquired lair, the cave beyond the river in the Umar Hills.~

@5025 = ~Defeating Khalabaxin

I have defeated the dragon Khalabaxin. I am now to return to the Order of the Radiant Heart and tell Sir Havun Clarenshide what has transpired.~

@5026 = ~Defeating Khalabaxin

I returned to the Radiant Heart with news of my defeat of the dragon Khalabaxin. The Order's work seems to be never done.~

@5027 = ~Defeating the Vampires

Sir Havun has informed me of the existence of a nest of vampires here in the city. I am to seek it out and destroy it. They live in the crypts beneath the graveyard. The Order will send one of their hireling wizards to aid me in breaching the lair's defenses.~

@5028 = ~Defeating the Vampires

I have destroyed the vampires, but the leader, Bodhi, has eluded me. She had some interesting things to say about me... She knew I was a child of Bhaal! I go now to report the destruction of the vampires to Sir Havun.~

@5029 = ~Vampires Defeated

I returned to the Radiant Heart with news of my defeat of the vampires. The Order has offered me passage to Spellhold as a reward!~
