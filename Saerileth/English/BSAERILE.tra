@14   = ~No, Saerileth, you are not a child to me.~
@15   = ~(Lean in and kiss Saerileth.)~
@16   = ~Thou art wise, <CHARNAME>. Beauty fades with age, but if thou lovest a woman for her heart, then thou may'st be happy with her all thy days.~
@17   = ~My thoughts exactly. And I think I may have found my woman.~

@28   = ~(Saerileth smiles, but there is still some hesitation in the blue of her eyes. She says nothing, however, but presses your hand.)~
@29   = ~(Saerileth shakes her head.) 'Tis no wisdom of mine, <CHARNAME>, but the grace of Tyr alone.~
@30   = ~(She smiles, and the roses in her cheeks deepen.) But I am glad that thou dost think likewise. Long love doth so.~

@32   = ~I understand. (Saerileth's eyes are softly blue and glitter with an unaccustomed shine. She begins to turn away.)~
@33   = ~But it doesn't really matter to me what a woman looks like. It matters what she *is* like.~

@62   = ~Aye, thou seest the right of it. And I am glad that we are--friends.~

@163  = ~Canst thou wonder at it? I am by thy side. How could it be that I do not smile?~

@182  = ~We're old enough to know our hearts, though.~
@183  = ~(Saerileth places her arms around your neck and kisses your mouth.) Indeed, my love. Thou and I are but a single soul now.~
@184  = ~(After a moment Saerileth continues.) Still, I would know why these others do accuse thee with their eyes.~
@185  = ~It is because you are so young, Saerileth.~
@186  = ~People think I am too old for you.~
@187  = ~I don't know. I don't care. I have you!~

@194  = ~Yet still I know not in what I do such wrong to draw the general eye.~

@214  = ~(Saerileth tilts her head to the side.) Surely thou knowest.~
@215  = ~Whene'er I take thy hand or--or touch thee, there do rest on thee many sharp looks. Why is it so?~
@216  = ~<CHARNAME>, I have not yet told thee of my captivity in--in Baator.~ [SAERI055]

@230  = ~And gives me yet, beloved of my heart.~

@238  = ~(Saerileth tilts her head to the left.) Then I do not understand.~

@246  = ~But these flowers are laid each night by my head. If they are not thy gift, then whence come they?~

@250  = ~Oh, for Bhaal's sake! Shut up about Tyr already!~
@251  = ~If you wouldn't mind telling, I've no objection to hearing.~
@252  = ~(Saerileth suddenly blushes.) 'Twas perhaps misleading to speak of a "tale".~

@255  = ~I see what you mean. It's an honor to serve a god in such a way.~
@256  = ~Tell me more about this. How did you know he had called you?~
@257  = ~'Tis the calling of the god that is rare. I do not mean to boast!~
@258  = ~(Saerileth catches herself up.) Tyr does not choose many for his paladins, but 'tis not our merit his eye seeks out.~
@259  = ~'Tis our willingness to serve.~
@260  = ~So, a willing heart is all that is required? I doubt that!~
@261  = ~I know at least why Tyr chose *you*.~

@266  = ~That doesn't make any sense.~
@267  = ~Did Tyr speak to you in a dream?~
@268  = ~(Saerileth's eyes dance as she replies.) The ever-blessed Tyr made his will most clear. He sent his image to me in a dream.~
@269  = ~I had my first vision of Tyr when I was but five years old. 'Twas the most precious sight of my life.~
@270  = ~From that time, the light of Tyr hath rested upon me.~
@271  = ~Aye. 'Tis more than willingness, I grant thee.~
@272  = ~I have known those who desired to serve so yet were not called to it. 'Tis also the will of the god.~
@273  = ~I am humbled that ever-blessed Tyr deigned to call me. (Saerileth smiles at you, a smile at once endearing and ethereal. She is, however, indisposed for further conversation.)~
@274  = ~(Saerileth blushes again.) Thou art too kind, <CHARNAME>, truly. 'Tis no merit of mine but the grace of Tyr.~
@275  = ~(Saerileth smiles at you, a smile at once endearing and ethereal. She is, however, indisposed for further conversation.)~
@276  = ~(Saerileth smiles in return.) There is no great mystery in my life, and thus there are but few tales of it.~
@277  = ~(Saerileth laughs shyly.) 'Tis my unpracticed speech that mars my tale.~
@278  = ~I was five years of age when I dreamt of Tyr. The Just One visited my mind by night, and he laid claim to my life.~
@279  = ~When I awoke from my slumbers, I told my father and my mother of this calling. They were honored, and I was presented to the temple the day following.~
@280  = ~Aye, he did.~

@284  = ~Good. Quiet at last.~
@285  = ~(Saerileth, still doubtful, turns back to face you.) 'Twas perhaps misleading to speak of a "tale".~
@286  = ~(Saerileth's eyes flash suddenly, and she sets her teeth.) Thou shalt hear no more from Saerileth!~
@287  = ~(You have just settled in for the night. A warm bowl of stew is in your hand, and Saerileth is smiling at you from the other side of the fire.)~
@288  = ~(Then the silence is broken.)~
@289  = ~(You have been marching for what seems an age, and you absently reach for your water-flask.)~
@290  = ~(Saerileth is there almost before you have realized it is empty.) Here, <CHARNAME>. Drink of mine.~ [SAERI059]
@291  = ~Thank you, Saerileth.~
@292  = ~No, thanks. I don't drink after other people.~
@293  = ~My love, you are ever here when I need you.~

@297  = ~Saerileth, I feel uncomfortable when you do that.~
@298  = ~(Kiss her fingertips.)~
@299  = ~(Smile at her.) Thank you, Saerileth.~

@302  = ~I'm worried that people might get the wrong idea about us.~
@303  = ~(Saerileth's whole body trembles, and she takes in her breath sharply.) <CHARNAME>.~
@304  = ~(She breathes your name like an invocation, and she stands motionless until you move.)~
@305  = ~Thou art most kindly welcome, <CHARNAME>. (Saerileth's tone gives the words unexpected depth of meaning.)~
@306  = ~Thou art welcome to aught that I may give.~
@307  = ~What meanest thou? (There is naked fear in Saerileth's eyes, such as you have never seen there in any battle.)~
@308  = ~Dost thou not love me?~
@309  = ~I never knew it 'til now, but I do! I *do* love you, Saerileth!~
@310  = ~No, Saerileth. I don't.~
@311  = ~I don't know yet, Saerileth.~
@312  = ~(Saerileth sighs and returns to her place, saddened by your rebuff.)~
@313  = ~My love and life! (Saerileth throws her arms around your waist and buries her face in your chest.)~
@314  = ~My heart is too full--oh, silence is the perfectest herald of joy!~
@315  = ~(Saerileth says nothing more, but her eloquent eyes speak for her.)~
@316  = ~Oh! (Saerileth flinches as though you have struck her in the face. Tears fill her eyes and rain down her cheeks.)~
@317  = ~(Her weeping is soft, but her face is utterly drained of color.)~
@318  = ~Not much longer can I endure it.~
@319  = ~(The words are not really addressed to you, and Saerileth returns to her place, wan and silent.)~
@320  = ~'Tis most strange in thee, <CHARNAME>. (Saerileth laughs lightly.)~
@321  = ~We eat from a common pot; we share a common skin from which we draw the water in our flasks; and yet thou wouldst still feign to thyself a separateness.~
@322  = ~(Saerileth has refilled your water during her speech.) Drink thou this.~
@323  = ~(When you have finished, she wipes the last drops from your face.)~
@324  = ~To serve thee is my delight. (Saerileth gives you her water-flask and watches you drink. When you have finished she wipes the last drops from your face.)~
@325  = ~I have come to hear much of thee, <CHARNAME>. I have heard that thou--alone no less!--didst prevent a war betwixt Baldur's Gate and Amn.~ [SAERI060]
@326  = ~It is true, Saerileth, but it seems like a dream, like all my life before I met you.~
@327  = ~Yes, it is true. I did do that.~
@328  = ~I don't like to talk about that.~
@329  = ~I had to kill my brother to do it.~
@330  = ~(Saerileth's face glows.) Thou art too kind, beloved. I, too, feel that my life began when first I saw thee.~
@331  = ~Never can I forget when I first heard thy voice.~
@332  = ~I was astonished to see a warrior so young--and so beautiful.~
@333  = ~(Kiss Saerileth.) That was the day Tyr allowed me to see his Chosen, Saerileth of the raven hair.~
@334  = ~But I think you asked me something about Baldur's Gate?~
@335  = ~Thou speak'st of my beauty, but 'tis nothing to thine. Thou art the fairest of all creatures I have e'er beheld.~
@336  = ~I am not so fair as, say, Lord Edorem.~

@338  = ~(You smile and shake your head.) But I think you asked me something about Baldur's Gate?~
@339  = ~(Saerileth leans in against you, her hair draped over your shoulder.) Mine own, thou art all that I could desire of the Blind God.~
@340  = ~I have known thee, and thus I need naught else.~
@341  = ~You see me through your love, Saerileth.~
@342  = ~Sometimes our happiness frightens me.~
@343  = ~Aye, my love. What is the truth of the tales I hear of thee? Is't true thou didst prevent a war?~
@344  = ~Lord Edorem? (Saerileth shakes her head.) That he is lovely, I grant thee, yet 'tis only *thy* beauty which stirs me.~
@345  = ~'Twas *thy* face which struck love into my heart. (Saerileth leans her cheek against yours.)~
@346  = ~Beloved, thou hast no cause for jealousy.~
@347  = ~And what other way is there to see thee? (Saerileth laughs gently.) Best beloved, I have loved thee since first I saw thee.~
@348  = ~Thy perfections didst enchant me from that moment. Nor could I have desired aught else.~
@349  = ~Think'st thou the gods are envious? (Saerileth's voice is grave.) 'Tis possible such happiness as ours is not meant for mortals on the Prime.~
@350  = ~Yet the ever-blessed Tyr is not envious, nor would he suffer such injustice as to strike us for our happiness.~
@351  = ~We have naught to fear.~
@352  = ~Yet thou dost speak of it so seldom. Is there mayhap some part of this tale that doth pain thee? Or is't thy humility?~
@353  = ~There really isn't anything to tell. Then as now, I did what I had to.~
@354  = ~It *was* painful. I had to kill my brother.~
@355  = ~I'm not modest. It's just that I don't dwell in the past.~
@356  = ~'Tis painful for thee. (Saerileth nods sympathetically.)~
@357  = ~Yet know that if thou wishest to share the burdens of thy heart, I am here to bear them with thee.~
@358  = ~To slay thy brother? (Saerileth's eyes are dim with horror and pity.)~
@359  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, 'tis a hard road the gods have set thee. Why, if thou canst speak of it, hadst thou to slay him?~
@360  = ~He tried to kill me.~
@361  = ~He was the one responsible for trying to start the war.~
@362  = ~(Saerileth does not smile, and her eyes are dark.) 'Tis not an easy thing to bear, this lonely destiny of thine.~
@363  = ~The past hath made us as we are, <CHARNAME>. We have chosen our steps, and the choice hath made us. Thine own way is a hard one.~
@364  = ~(Saerileth smiles, but the gravity remains in her eyes.) Yet know that if thou wishest to share the burdens of thy heart, I am here to bear them with thee.~
@365  = ~(Saerileth takes your hand.) Beloved, there is no cause for thee to bear even the burden of thy past alone.~
@366  = ~I am ever with thee, to aid thee. Canst thou speak of it?~
@367  = ~You are too good to me, Saerileth. Sometimes our happiness frightens me.~
@368  = ~It was painful. I had to kill my brother.~
@369  = ~(Saerileth's face drains of color, and she clutches convulsively at your hand.)~
@370  = ~Well I know that thy danger is ever-present, but never can I hear of it without it striking fear into me afresh.~
@371  = ~(Saerileth's breath is quick and shallow for long thereafter.)~
@372  = ~At times the demands of justice are difficult. (Saerileth's eyes are soft, and her voice is gentle.)~
@373  = ~<CHARNAME>, thou art strong not to have faltered when justice demanded the blood of thy brother. I do honor thee.~
@374  = ~(You have settled in for the night and are rifling through your pack for a relatively clean shirt.)~
@375  = ~(Your searching fingers close around a small scroll that you know was not there when you got up. Pulling it out, you recognize Saerileth's handwriting.)~
@376  = ~(Read it aloud.)~
@377  = ~(Read it silently.)~
@378  = ~(Throw it into the fire unopened.)~
@379  = ~What is this, beloved?~
@380  = ~(Saerileth's voice joins with yours, repeating the words she has written.)~
@381  = ~Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.~ [SAERI061]
@382  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, I am ill at these rhymes, but that I love thee best, most best, believe it.~
@383  = ~(Saerileth has drawn nearer to you as she spoke, and she stands before you, her too-blue eyes fixed on yours.)~
@384  = ~That was beautiful, Saerileth.~
@385  = ~Saerileth, I do not share your feelings.~
@386  = ~Saerileth, I could not doubt your love--or my own for you!~
@387  = ~Ah, my Saerileth. You always find new ways to show your love.~
@388  = ~That was just what I needed, Saerileth. (Kiss her.)~
@389  = ~(Saerileth blushes.) I hoped that to know of my love would--would give thee joy.~
@390  = ~Of course it does, beloved.~
@391  = ~It does, Saerileth. For I love you, too!~
@392  = ~You are ever there when I need you, Saerileth.~
@393  = ~Your love is all my joy.~
@394  = ~No, Saerileth. You can be only a friend to me.~
@395  = ~(Saerileth's eyes darken, the blue seeming nearly black in the firelight.)~
@396  = ~I had feared such an answer. (Her voice trembles.) I do love thee, <CHARNAME>. That thou lovest not me is--~
@397  = ~(Her voice fails her, and she turns away.)~
@398  = ~Thou lovest me! (Saerileth laughs aloud and holds out her hands to you.)~
@399  = ~I had hoped it, but thou hadst never *said* that thou loved me. Ah, my love!~
@400  = ~I was not sure of my heart, Saerileth. I had to wait until I *knew*.~
@401  = ~I just wanted to wait for the right time to tell you.~
@402  = ~(Kiss Saerileth.)~
@403  = ~(Saerileth smiles and sits beside you.) There is no end to my love, thus no end to the ways to say I love thee.~
@404  = ~Well, I will be content with this one: I love you.~
@405  = ~I look forward to hearing them all.~
@406  = ~I do try, beloved of my heart. I try to discern thy need and to meet it.~
@407  = ~If only I couldst so easily remedy all that aileth thee.~
@408  = ~You are all I need, Saerileth.~
@409  = ~Ah, beloved of my heart, it is the study of my days to give thee joy.~
@410  = ~(Saerileth's face lights with ecstasy.) My <CHARNAME>! (She presses her hands together.)~
@411  = ~I have longed to hear thee say so. I had hoped that thou loved, but thou hadst never *said* it. Ah, my love!~
@412  = ~(Saerileth sighs contentedly.) I regret not my patience. To have thy love at the last was all my desire.~
@413  = ~(She presses your hand to her cheek.) Mine own, my treasure. At last, my joy is full.~
@414  = ~I regret not my patience. (Saerileth sighs deeply, a sound of rich content.) To have thy love at the last was all my desire.~
@415  = ~(Saerileth melts into your kiss, her lips burning into yours with a chaste passion.)~
@416  = ~And I thee, <CHARNAME>.~
@417  = ~(Saerileth smiles shyly and intertwines her fingers with yours.) Thus do my hands speak also to thee.~
@418  = ~Then thou shalt never want, for ever shall I be with thee.~
@419  = ~(It is a moment before you realize that Saerileth is saying the words with you.)~
@420  = ~(As the flames lick the parchment you see Saerileth's face pale as death. She speaks in a low voice, shaken by your burning of her letter.)~
@421  = ~Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.~ [SAERI062]
@422  = ~(Saerileth laughs.) Shall I read it to thee? (She takes the letter and begins to speak.)~
@423  = ~(Her eyes, however, are not on the parchment, but your face.)~
@424  = ~Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.~
@425  = ~(You and Saerileth sit side by side, and her head rests on your shoulder. Suddenly she stirs and sits up, as though about to speak.)~
@426  = ~(Before any words pass her lips, however, you hear the by-now-familiar sound of a planar conduit opening.)~
@427  = ~Hadst thou ever loved another ere me?~ [SAERI063]
@428  = ~What brought this on?~
@429  = ~This is because of Edorem, isn't it?~
@430  = ~No, of course not, Saerileth.~
@431  = ~There have been others I've cared about, but I've only *loved* you.~
@432  = ~I have loved before, yes.~
@433  = ~(Saerileth's cheeks are flaming as she responds.) 'Tis--'tis Lord Edorem, beloved.~
@434  = ~He loves me. I did not love him! (Saerileth is obviously anxious to reassure you.)~
@435  = ~But 'tis clear that he hath loved me all this while. And I feared that thou hadst also perhaps so loved.~
@436  = ~Please, tell me truly. Is't so?~
@437  = ~(Saerileth's face brightens at once, and she presses your hand to her cheek.)~
@438  = ~I am glad, glad to hear thee say so!~
@439  = ~But what about you, Saerileth? Have you ever been in love before?~
@440  = ~Is there anyone else in *your* past I should know about?~
@441  = ~(Kiss Saerileth.) I am happy I saved my heart for you.~
@442  = ~Others thou hast cared for? (Saerileth's eyes cloud over like a summer sky.) What doth this mean?~
@443  = ~I've had friends, women who were dear to me, but I've never been "in love" before.~
@444  = ~There were others I thought I loved, but when I met you, I knew I had been wrong.~
@445  = ~And thy love hath ended. (Saerileth's voice shakes.)~
@446  = ~Wherefore hast thou given thy heart and taken it back again?~
@447  = ~Because the girl I loved didn't want my heart.~
@448  = ~I don't know. We just didn't stay in love.~
@449  = ~Are you saying you've never loved anyone before me?~
@450  = ~I? Nay, my love! (Saerileth's wide, clear eyes do not admit of doubt.)~
@451  = ~I have loved my father and my brothers, but the love of a maid for a man had never entered my heart 'til I beheld thy face.~
@452  = ~(Saerileth sighs softly.) That my heart I hadst given thee unsullied I pray that thou dost know, but if thou meanest if I know of another who hath desired my love, nay, I know of none.~
@453  = ~(Saerileth drops her eyes.) Yet I confess that I knew not that Lord Edorem didst hold me so dear.~
@454  = ~As am I, beloved! (Saerileth brings your hands to her lips and kisses them gently.)~
@455  = ~'Twould be worth for this to die.~
@456  = ~(Saerileth nods solemnly.) Indeed, the holy fathers were close to my heart, and Lord Edorem didst have a place no less dear to me than that of mine own brothers.~
@457  = ~But the love of a maid for a man had never entered my heart 'til I beheld thy face.~
@458  = ~Thou hadst no parents' love to see and know from their love what the love of a man for a maid shouldst be.~
@459  = ~(Saerileth presses your hand.) Still, thou hast found love at last.~
@460  = ~(Saerileth smiles, though her cobalt eyes swim with tears.) Her folly wast then my gain.~
@461  = ~(She quickly kisses your cheek and returns to her place in formation, her shoulders shaking.)~
@462  = ~And yet thou loved her as thou sayest thou love me? (Saerileth turns away from you and covers her face with her hands.)~
@463  = ~If thy love for--for *her* wast so changeable, how can I know that thy love for me will not alter?~
@464  = ~Because you are not she. That which I love in you will not change.~
@465  = ~You can't know. Feelings change. But isn't love worth the risk?~
@466  = ~How can *I* know you won't stop loving *me*?~
@467  = ~I have not, not with the love of a maid for a man. (Saerileth takes your hands and skewers you with her cobalt gaze.)~
@468  = ~Speak truth to thy Saerileth. If that thy love hath proved so variable that thou hast loved and failed--~
@469  = ~(Her voice falters, and her eyes speak for her.)~
@470  = ~Would you have me leave my heart with one who did not want it?~
@471  = ~Would you have remain with a girl I didn't have feelings for?~
@472  = ~Ah. (Saerileth's face clears slightly.) So thy love fell from the light.~
@473  = ~I do pity thee because of it. But for that I honor the Maimed Tyr above thee, thou needst not fear that.~
@474  = ~(Saerileth smiles, though tears still stain her cheeks.) Her folly was my gain.~
@475  = ~(She presses your hand quickly and returns to her place in formation, her shoulders shaking.)~
@476  = ~(Saerileth shakes her head.) Nay, <CHARNAME>, thou and I henceforth are twain.~
@477  = ~Thou knowest not what love is, and I shall bear my folly as best I can. My heart is not for thee.~
@478  = ~Love is more than a fleeting affection! An emotion mayest be changed by the weather or by the state of thy stomach!~
@479  = ~Love is no emotion, and I shall love thee no more--in despite of mine emotions.~
@480  = ~My love is not subject to the whims of mine emotions. I love thee with my reason.~
@481  = ~I love thee by choice, by my will. And thou?~
@482  = ~Love is the greatest feeling, and I never want it to end.~
@483  = ~You are right, Saerileth. I have learned that since I last loved.~
@484  = ~You have shown me how to love, Saerileth, and I *choose* to love you.~
@485  = ~Then, if thou choosest to love, I need not fear thy love's loss.~
@486  = ~(Saerileth smiles sweetly at you, though her eyes still are sad.)~
@487  = ~Aye, beloved. Thou seest much.~
@488  = ~Lord Edorem loves me. I did not love him! (Saerileth is obviously anxious to reassure you.)~
@489  = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, tell me of Gorion.~ [SAERI064]
@490  = ~Saerileth, I'm sorry. I don't like to talk about him.~
@491  = ~Gorion was the only father I acknowledge. I wish others would see it that way.~
@492  = ~Gorion was a good, kind man who loved me very much.~
@493  = ~Gorion meant well, but he was quite a bore.~
@494  = ~(Saerileth takes your hand.) Mine own, I am thine, and I wouldst know more thy past, of that which hath made thee who thou art.~
@495  = ~I just can't, Saerileth. I watched Gorion die. He was cut down in front of me.~
@496  = ~Gorion was good to me. He loved me.~
@497  = ~I miss him very much.~
@498  = ~I knew it not. (Saerileth's voice is low and full of pity.) Forgive me, beloved.~
@499  = ~I would never have spoken had I known.~
@500  = ~I know, Saerileth. It's all right.~
@501  = ~Never mind. I am glad that you know.~
@502  = ~Just leave me alone, Saerileth.~
@503  = ~And he was a father to thee. How did he bring thee up?~
@504  = ~He was strict, but loving. I never doubted his care for me.~
@505  = ~He was absentminded, but he always had time to listen.~
@506  = ~He devoted himself to my education. It is hard to believe he would do that for a Bhaalspawn.~
@507  = ~Nevertheless, I do ask thy forgiveness. (And Saerileth kisses your hand.)~
@508  = ~As am I. If ever thou wouldst speak again of him, I would be honored to listen.~
@509  = ~Aye, my love. (Saerileth, her face flushed with shame, resumes her place in formation, not daring to raise her eyes to your face.)~
@510  = ~Mine own father was much the same, but I didst not dwell with him after my fifth year. Still, I knew his love.~
@511  = ~I am glad that thy father loved thee. Beloved sons do make the best fathers.~
@512  = ~Thy words recall to me my mother. She was even so. I didst not dwell with her after my fifth, but still I knew her love.~
@513  = ~He loved thee. Is't so hard for thee to believe? And I, too, love thee. For love there is no sacrifice too great.~
@514  = ~'Tis difficult for thee. (Saerileth sighs softly.) Wilt thou speak more of thy father to me?~
@515  = ~A bore? (Saerileth laughs lightly.) That I cannot believe for he raised *thee*. Wilt thou not speak more of him to me?~
@516  = ~Wilt thou not tell me more of thy family?~ [SAERI065]
@517  = ~What would you like to know?~
@518  = ~I don't have any family left.~
@519  = ~There's really only Imoen left.~
@520  = ~I know not what to ask. I know naught of thy family apart from some little of Gorion.~
@521  = ~There isn't anything else *to* say. Gorion was all I had.~
@522  = ~Apart from him, there's really only Imoen left.~
@523  = ~I wish that I had some family besides a dead god.~
@524  = ~I pity thee, beloved, truly. My family wast ever so full of love and devotion--I do wish that thou couldst have known such.~
@525  = ~Well, it's too late for that.~
@526  = ~I do, too, but it is not now worth regretting.~
@527  = ~At least I still have Imoen.~
@528  = ~Imoen, thy friend from thy youth. Please tell me more of thy childhood with her, mine own.~
@529  = ~I'm sorry. It is too hard when I know she is imprisoned!~
@530  = ~She is like a sister to me. We grew up together, and I won't rest until she is rescued!~
@531  = ~She was something of a prankster, and she was always getting me into trouble.~
@532  = ~We didn't really get along, but that doesn't mean I'm going to leave her in trouble.~
@533  = ~Nay, <CHARNAME>, 'tis not too late. Though thou may'st no longer know the love of a family wherein thou art the son, thou mayest yet know one wherein thou art the father.~
@534  = ~(There is a conscious blush on Saerileth's face, and she says no more.)~
@535  = ~Thou seest the right of it, <CHARNAME>. For though thou may'st no longer know the love of a family wherein thou art the son, thou mayest yet know one wherein thou art the father.~
@536  = ~And we shall save her, my heart! Thine honor is bound no less than thy brother's love, and we shall save her.~
@537  = ~(Saerileth leans her brow to yours and looks into your eyes.) Fear not, my best beloved one. Thine Imoen shall be with us again.~
@538  = ~She was dear to thee nonetheless?~

@543  = ~She was always like my sister, even before we knew that we were siblings.~
@544  = ~Why don't you ask her?~
@545  = ~Of course, mine own. And justice shall be visited upon him in the name of Tyr and for Imoen's sake--and thine.~
@546  = ~And the wrongs that were visited upon her must therefore pain thee the more.~
@547  = ~(Saerileth leans her brow to yours and looks into your eyes.) Fear not, my best beloved one.~
@548  = ~Thy wrongs and those of thy sister Imoen shall be righted, in the name of Evenhanded Tyr.~
@549  = ~Yet still thou sought her, even when thou knewest not she was thy sister. Thou must then have loved her, and the wrongs that were visited upon her must therefore pain thee the more.~
@550  = ~Perhaps then I will, <CHARNAME>. (Saerileth laughs lightly.)~
@551  = ~But thou mayest regret the words, for what a sister says of the past doth not always match the brother's memories!~
@552  = ~(You have settled in for the evening, and Saerileth, as usual, is nestled at your side as you sit before the fire.)~
@553  = ~(Suddenly she speaks.) <CHARNAME>, canst thou dance?~ [SAERI066]
@554  = ~Dance? Of course not!~
@555  = ~(Lie.) Of course I can.~
@556  = ~(Tell the truth.) Yes, I can.~
@557  = ~A bard is able to do many things. Dancing is among them.~

@584  = ~Actually, I will dance.~
@585  = ~(Saerileth's face clouds like the summer sky.) Please, love, do not deceive me, even in jest.~
@586  = ~(She presses your hand and kisses it.) If we are not to dance, I will to bed.~
@587  = ~(Saerileth smiles in innocent pleasure.) First do thou mirror me.~
@588  = ~Then do thou dance with me!~
@589  = ~(Saerileth has pulled you to your feet almost before you have realized you are no longer seated.)~
@590  = ~Follow my lead, Saerileth!~
@591  = ~But why not? (Saerileth's wide are too astonished yet to be hurt.)~
@592  = ~Because I am weary.~
@593  = ~(Saerileth gamely attempts to follow you, and for a while she succeeds.)~
@594  = ~(At last you lose her in the steps, and she stops, breathless and smiling.)~
@595  = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>, no more can I dance this eve. (She places a kiss on your lips, and she is gone.)~
@596  = ~(Saerileth's hand is instantly pressed to your cheek.) Thou art not fevered. (There is relief in her voice.)~
@597  = ~Still, thy lot is a hard one. Lie down, my soul, and sleep. (She kisses your lips once and leads you to your bed.)~
@598  = ~Sleep sweetly, my <CHARNAME>. (And she is gone.)~
@599  = ~(It is late, and Saerileth sits curled up against you. All others are abed, and you are alone with her.)~
@600  = ~(The firelight plays in the glossy black of her hair. Her beauty is intoxicating, and her nearness is arousing.)~
@601  = ~Saerileth, will you make love to me?~

@605  = ~(Cuddle with Saerileth and say nothing.)~
@606  = ~(Saerileth's face pales.) Thou canst not mean now?~ [SAERI067]
@607  = ~Yes, now.~
@608  = ~(Rise.) Forgive me, Saerileth. My passion overcame my judgement.~
@609  = ~(Lean in and kiss Saerileth with passion.)~
@610  = ~(Saerileth rises and steps back from you, her eyes dim with tears.)~
@611  = ~Ah, my <CHARNAME>, 'tis wrong in thee to ask this of me. We are not yet wed.~
@612  = ~That doesn't matter! We love each other!~
@613  = ~Please, Saerileth. If you loved me, you would want to do it, too.~
@614  = ~(Hold out your hand to her.) Please, Saerileth, forgive me! I became impassioned by your beauty.~

@617  = ~(Saerileth pushes you away from her, her breast heaving.) Nay, <CHARNAME>! Thou must not!~
@618  = ~(Tears flood her eyes, and she scrambles further away from you.)~
@619  = ~Wait, Saerileth! Please--I became inflamed with desire for your beauty--~
@620  = ~(Grab her hand and pull her to you, pressing your lips to hers.) I need you, Saerileth.~
@621  = ~Nay, <CHARNAME>. (Saerileth backs farther away from you.) To become one with thee is not merely the outpouring of passion.~
@622  = ~'Tis also the promise of a future generation. 'Tis not right that this shouldst go unaccompanied by the nuptial vow.~
@623  = ~I do grieve that it must be so, but, <CHARNAME>, thou and my heart henceforth shall be twain. No more may I love thee.~
@624  = ~(Saerileth leaves you then, her jaw set, despite the wetness of her eyes.)~

@626  = ~Thou knowest not what love is, nor hast thou ever spoken troth to me! (Saerileth turns her back on you.)~
@627  = ~Thy serpent heart wast hid with a flowering face. Never, never may I love thee!~
@628  = ~(Saerileth nods, hesitation and fear still in her eyes.) Aye, mine own. I forgive thee. I will retire now, as ought thou.~
@629  = ~Inflamed with desire for that not lawfully thine own?~
@630  = ~Saerileth, if you loved me, you'd want to do it, too.~

@635  = ~(Saerileth at first returns your kiss, but your growing passion frightens her.)~
@636  = ~(She pulls away from your kiss.) <CHARNAME>? What is it thou wouldst ask of me?~ [SAERI068]
@637  = ~I want you to make love to me.~
@638  = ~I hardly know. My passion blinded me. Forgive me, Saerileth.~
@639  = ~I think I should go to bed now, Saerileth. I'm sorry if I frightened you.~
@640  = ~(Saerileth smiles sweetly.) My gentle love. 'Twas as much mine own passion as thine which struck fear into my heart.~
@641  = ~Thou art wise to sleep now. So also shall I do. Goodnight, my beloved.~
@642  = ~Is aught amiss? (Saerileth's eyes instantly darken, and she takes your hand.) I am here to aid thee, to comfort thee.~ [SAERI069]
@643  = ~I don't need you to "comfort" me. I need you to make love to me.~
@644  = ~Saerileth, your beauty inflames me, and I think I ought to go to bed now.~
@645  = ~Nothing is wrong. I just need to get some sleep.~
@646  = ~(Saerileth's face is scarlet as she replies.) Thou art wise, my love, and I thank thee for this care of my virtue.~
@647  = ~Rest well, <CHARNAME>. (And she is gone.)~
@648  = ~Very well, beloved. (Saerileth gives you her accustomed goodnight kiss and goes to her bed.)~
@649  = ~Mine own, rarely do we have a time of quiet and rest; thus this now is most precious. I do feel thy spirit speaking to mine.~
@650  = ~Our communion needeth not words.~
@651  = ~(Take Saerileth in your arms and kiss her passionately.)~
@652  = ~(Give Saerileth a chaste kiss.)~
@653  = ~Saerileth, I feel the world is perfect as I sit here by the fire holding you.~
@654  = ~(Saerileth responds by nestling into your arms and laying her head upon your shoulder.)~
@655  = ~Mine own <CHARNAME>, I love thee.~
@656  = ~(For long you sit together, neither of you willing to break your fellowship. But the need for sleep eventually overcomes you both, and you retire to your beds.)~
@657  = ~'Tis true, my love. The daily hardships, the battles, and the blood are all fled away. In all the world there is naught but thee and me.~
@658  = ~(Saerileth approaches you with an impish smile on her face.) Knowest thou much of wine?~ [SAERI070]
@659  = ~I know a bit about that as most things.~
@660  = ~Yes, a little.~
@661  = ~Not much.~
@662  = ~I know what grapes are best for it.~
@663  = ~Ah, my star. I shouldst have known it. Yet still I think that this mayst surprise thee.~
@664  = ~(She shyly holds out a bottle of wine. Though it is obviously ancient, it is not dusty.)~
@665  = ~I found this when last we were in the Temple district of Athkatla. I bought it and saved it for thee.~
@666  = ~Wine? You, Saerileth?~
@667  = ~Thank you, Saerileth. What's the occasion?~
@668  = ~I don't really drink wine.~
@669  = ~(Saerileth's face is blank.) There is naught immoral about the fruit of the vine. 'Tis true one shouldst not drink to drunkenness, but that is all.~
@670  = ~Why shouldst thou be surprised?~
@671  = ~Because you're so young.~
@672  = ~No reason. What's the occasion?~
@673  = ~But, Saerileth, I don't really drink wine.~
@674  = ~I wish to celebrate that I love thee and that thou lovest me. Need I other occasion?~
@675  = ~No, Saerileth. That's enough reason to celebrate!~
@676  = ~(Saerileth's face falls, and she looks away.) I ought to have known it. I have never seen thee drink spirits.~
@677  = ~Forgive my boldness, beloved. (Saerileth returns to her place, crestfallen.)~
@678  = ~Of course, mine own! (Saerileth's face is scarlet.) I ought to have known that thou mayest not drink strong drink.~
@679  = ~'Tis against thy discipline. (Saerileth presses your hand quickly and returns to her place, still shame-faced.)~
@680  = ~(Saerileth smiles.) I am not so young as that. In my father's house wine was as common as water.~
@681  = ~So, wilt thou drink?~
@682  = ~Yes, Saerileth. What's the occasion?~
@683  = ~So I thought! (Saerileth hands you the bottle.) Thus do I drink to our love.~
@684  = ~(Saerileth returns your kiss with passion. When your kiss ends, leaving you breathless, she slides the bottle into your hands.)~
@685  = ~Thus do we drink to our love.~
@686  = ~Never dost thou cease to show me new parts of thyself. Still I think that this mayst surprise thee.~
@687  = ~Then this will certainly surprise thee.~
@688  = ~(Saerileth shyly holds out a bottle of wine. Though it is obviously ancient, it is not dusty.)~
@689  = ~But know'st thou the flavors? (Saerileth shyly holds out a bottle of wine. Though it is obviously ancient, it is not dusty.)~
@690  = ~I hope that this may yet surprise thee. I found this when last we were in the Temple district of Athkatla. I bought it and saved it for thee.~
@691  = ~Hast thou still any friends from thy childhood?~ [SAERI071]
@692  = ~No, not really.~
@693  = ~Only Imoen.~
@694  = ~I miss many friends, but since I left Candlekeep I haven't seen any of them.~
@695  = ~Thou spent little time, then, outside the monastery?~
@696  = ~No, not much time.~
@697  = ~Actually I did, but never openly, so I didn't make friends that way.~
@698  = ~I did, but only in the surrounding woods and fields.~
@699  = ~Thy friends then were the books of the library?~
@700  = ~Yes, that's right. And good friends they were, too!~
@701  = ~Yes, and I still have some of them.~
@702  = ~No, I preferred the weapons in the armory.~
@703  = ~No, my companion was my music.~
@704  = ~Is't easier then for thee now, for thou hast less to regret?~
@705  = ~I'd never thought of it like that, but you're right.~
@706  = ~No, I still miss Candlekeep. It was my home.~
@707  = ~It makes me regret instead never having a home.~
@708  = ~Thy friends then were the beasts and birds?~
@709  = ~Yes, and good friends they were, too!~
@710  = ~Yes, and I still like to see them when I can.~
@711  = ~No, I just practiced my fighting out there!~
@712  = ~That was where I practiced my music.~
@713  = ~Books are friends that never leave. (Saerileth traces the shape of your nose with her forefinger.)~
@714  = ~Beloved of my heart, I do hope that when thou canst build thine own home there will be in it space for the old friends of thy youth to be met by the new friends of thy maturity, for I would read these books.~
@715  = ~The weapons of a warrior are ever his trusted friends. (Saerileth traces the shape of your nose with her forefinger.)~
@716  = ~But I pray that thou may'st have a home where thou might, at least within its walls, be free to lay aside thine arms and delight in the fellowship of those who love thee.~
@717  = ~And now thy music is a friend also to me.~
@718  = ~(Saerileth laughs and traces your fingers with hers.) I thank thee for sharing this friend with me.~
@719  = ~I do hope that thou and I canst make a home which there will never be cause for thee to leave. (Saerileth sighs softly.)~
@720  = ~I do pray Tyr that it might be so.~
@721  = ~Thou must needs then find a new home. I do hope that thou and I canst make a home there will never be cause for thee to leave. (Saerileth sighs softly.)~
@722  = ~I had not known their attractions until thou shewest them to me.~
@723  = ~I thank thee for sharing thy friends with me, and I hope that one day I canst show thee the wilds around my home.~
@724  = ~There wouldst be many beasts and birds for thee to know.~
@725  = ~Then I hope that thou and I canst make a home where the beasts and birds do gambol freely with the children there.~
@726  = ~(Saerileth sighs softly, interlacing her fingers with yours.) I pray Tyr it might be so.~
@727  = ~Then thou and Imoen spent little time outside the monastery?~
@728  = ~Thy life now is that of a wanderer. Didst thou wander, too, when thou wert a child? Didst thou spend most of thy time outside the monastery?~
@729  = ~Yes, I did. I was always creeping out to the villages.~
@730  = ~Then I hope that, when at last thou and I canst make a home, these friends of thy youth canst come to us, to visit us.~
@731  = ~I would know those who have known thee.~
@732  = ~(You feel Saerileth's eyes on you and glance up to see her smiling pensively.)~
@733  = ~Forgive me, beloved. 'Twas that the turn of thy head just so didst call to mind my brother Caladus.~ [SAERI072]
@734  = ~Why?~
@735  = ~Tell me about Caladus.~
@736  = ~Tell me more about your family.~
@737  = ~Is that a good thing?~
@738  = ~'Tis not thy looks! (Saerileth laughs gently.) Caladus hath skin of emerald green.~
@739  = ~It is for that he, too, wouldst look into the horizon with that hawk's eye. He was ever a kind brother to me.~
@740  = ~(Saerileth's face is nearly sad.)~
@741  = ~Tell me more about Caladus.~
@742  = ~I'd like to hear more about your family.~
@743  = ~You miss him, don't you?~
@744  = ~Caladus is mine eldest brother. He is now one and thirty. He is my father's heir and like him studieth the arcane.~
@745  = ~He hath now no wife, however, and the next generation of the Lords of Everspring hath been secured by Tal, who hath already a son.~
@746  = ~Why isn't Caladus married?~
@747  = ~Is your father disappointed?~
@748  = ~"Now" no wife?~
@749  = ~How old is Tal?~
@750  = ~Aye. 'Tis strange, for I have never dwelt with him. He was from home for a few years, sojourning in the Planes.~
@751  = ~But he camest most often to visit me in the temple. I pity him as well as love him.~
@752  = ~Why do you pity him?~
@753  = ~Where does Caladus live now?~
@754  = ~What does Caladus do?~
@755  = ~(Saerileth's eyes deepen to midnight blue as she answers.)~
@756  = ~Caladus was wed at one and twenty. The maid was of the eladrin. She loved him passing well, and he her.~
@757  = ~She died in childbed with their firstborn. He will not wed again. (Saerileth holds tightly to your hand.)~
@758  = ~But he would not wish my pity, for he hath had his heart's desire, though he hath lost her.~
@759  = ~Disappointed? Nay. Caladus was wed at one and twenty. The maid was of the eladrin. She loved him passing well, and he her.~
@760  = ~He doth dwell in my father's house, the ancestral home of the Lords of Everspring.~
@761  = ~'Twas there he took his bride, a maiden of the eladrin. (Saerileth sighs before continuing.)~
@762  = ~She loved him passing well, and he her.~
@763  = ~Caladus hath taken up much of the burden of lordship over the lands of Everspring. He is my father's heir and like him studieth the arcane.~
@764  = ~Tal is next after Caladus, and he is six and twenty. Tarin is four and twenty.~
@765  = ~My parents had thought to have no more children, but Tyr granted me to them when my mother was three and thirty.~
@766  = ~They were honored, and my mother spent many hours in her orisons whilst she carried me, thanking Tyr and Ilmater for granting her another babe.~
@767  = ~Aye, 'tis a good thing! (Saerileth smiles.) Thou 'tis not thy looks which doth bring him to my mind, for Caladus hath skin of emerald green.~
@768  = ~(You have settled in for the night, and already you are lost to the world. Still, your senses have long been attuned to the life of an adventurer, and you are fully awake before you know why.)~
@769  = ~(You realize that Saerileth is not far from you.)~
@770  = ~(Say nothing and try to get some rest.)~
@771  = ~Saerileth, what are you doing here?~
@772  = ~Is something wrong, Saerileth?~
@773  = ~(Saerileth gives no sign that she has noticed your wakefulness. She continues to murmur softly under her breath.)~
@774  = ~May the blessing of Tyr rest ever on his brow. May the light of goodness never leave his heart.~ [SAERI073]
@775  = ~(The prayer continues, eventually lulling you back into oblivion.)~
@776  = ~(Saerileth starts.) Did I wake thee, beloved? Forgive me.~ [SAERI074]
@777  = ~(A becoming blush suffuses Saerileth's face.) 'Tis the Day of the Three, the day when Torm and Ilmater do appear before Tyr.~
@778  = ~On this day not only doth the Evenhanded Tyr give ear to my prayers, but also the Crying God and Torm the Steadfast.~
@779  = ~'Tis the custom of the Lords of Everspring to, on the Day of the Three, offer up to Tyr and his vassals all that is dear to us.~
@780  = ~And for you that is me.~
@781  = ~May I join you?~
@782  = ~(Smile and yawn.) Does this last all night?~
@783  = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>, for thou art in my very heart of heart. Thus, I do offer thee to Tyr and do ask his blessing--and that of Ilmater and that of Torm--upon thee.~
@784  = ~Thou art not offended?~
@785  = ~Of course not, Saerileth. How could I be offended at something that shows so much of your love?~
@786  = ~I am. I'm not exactly *yours* to offer, you know.~
@787  = ~Truly? Thou wouldst wish to join with me? (Saerileth claps her hands in delight.)~
@788  = ~Then offer up to Tyr, and therefore to his vassals, all that is dearest to thy heart.~
@789  = ~(Shyly, Saerileth takes your hand and leads you through the intricate forms of the prayer.)~
@790  = ~(It is over an hour before she returns to her bed, leaving you with the image of her bowed head and closed eyes.)~
@791  = ~Not *all* night, mine own. Only for an hour yet. (Saerileth smiles shyly.) I will be quieter that thou mayest rest.~
@792  = ~(It is indeed over an hour before Saerileth returns to her bed, leaving you with the memory of her whispered orisons in which your name was ever foremost.)~
@793  = ~(Saerileth releases her breath in a sudden expression of thankfulness.) I am glad. I had feared that thou mightest be displeased at my forwardness, coming thus to thy side by night.~
@794  = ~Yet 'tis the way of my people. And if thou art not offended, I will complete the rite.~
@795  = ~(It is over an hour before Saerileth returns to her bed, leaving you with the image of her bowed head and closed eyes.)~
@796  = ~Forgive me! (Saerileth turns and flees from you, running to her own bed.)~
@797  = ~Ah, nay beloved. All is well. 'Tis only that 'tis the Day of the Three, the day when Torm and Ilmater do appear before Tyr.~ [SAERI075]
@798  = ~<CHARNAME>, what is the purpose of marriage?~ [SAERI076]
@799  = ~(Stare at Saerileth in shocked silence.)~
@800  = ~Why do you want to know?~
@801  = ~Procreation--the birth of children.~
@802  = ~To be forever with the one you love.~
@803  = ~To have the joy of knowing that I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine.~
@804  = ~I don't really believe in marriage.~
@805  = ~(Saerileth laughs softly.) <CHARNAME>, 'tis not so strange a question. I wouldst know if thy thought and mine are the one.~
@806  = ~(Saerileth nods vigorously.) Aye, that is indeed a primary purpose of marriage. I think, too, that the joy and help that one ought to have of the other is also a part.~
@807  = ~And, of course, to maintain chastity.~
@808  = ~Yes, I see that.~
@809  = ~Is a marriage which fails to produce children cause for divorce?~
@810  = ~I don't think marriage is necessary for that. Children, companionship--you can have those things without marriage.~
@811  = ~I am--pleased that thou and I are in such accord.~
@812  = ~(Saerileth's face is flushed a becoming shade of pink, and she walks hand-in-hand with you for some time.)~
@813  = ~Nay! (Saerileth's reaction is immediate.)~
@814  = ~Divorce? 'Tis a horror! Only the breaking of the marriage vow--adultery--is grounds for divorce.~
@815  = ~And in the lands of Everspring 'tis an offense punishable by death, so divorce is there unknown.~
@816  = ~That seems harsh.~
@817  = ~Well, that's part of why I don't like marriage. Children, companionship--you can have those things without marriage.~
@818  = ~Is there no room for repentance and mercy then, in Everspring?~
@819  = ~Wherefore wouldst thou wish bastardy upon thy children? Wherefore wouldst thou wish to make thy love a loose woman?~
@820  = ~Marriage is the vow which gives to thy children and thy wife the security of thy presence and the protection of thy name.~
@821  = ~If I love my children, they're not really bastards. That's only a label of society; it means nothing.~
@822  = ~It is the presence of love that makes the act of sex right or wrong. If I love her, then she is not "loose" if she sleeps with me.~
@823  = ~I'd never really thought about it like that before.~
@824  = ~There is. (Saerileth's eyes are pained.) If th'offended one, the one who wast betrayed, doth choose not to make the injury public, then 'tis possible.~
@825  = ~If a lady so injured can again accept her lord, or the lord his lady, then 'tis permitted.~
@826  = ~But if the betrayal is openly known, or if the injured one doth publicly prove 'tis so, then there is no clemency.~
@827  = ~The sanctity of marriage must be preserved for all.~
@828  = ~I still think that's awful.~
@829  = ~I can see your point, but I think the punishment is too harsh.~
@830  = ~I had never thought about the public aspect of marriage before.~
@831  = ~'Tis selfishness to wish to take a maiden's virtue and give her no name of wife in return.~
@832  = ~What is she to thee then but a harlot?~
@833  = ~Love should be enough. Who needs the public declaration?~
@834  = ~If I love her, then she is no harlot, but my love. Who cares what other people say?~
@835  = ~Love doth demand a vow. 'Tis the nature of love to be sole possessor and solely possessed.~
@836  = ~There is more to marriage than conjugal rights. If thou dost love, thou dost desire to have thy beloved thine alone.~
@837  = ~(Saerileth's face is grey, and her jaw sets.) Thy words have shown me that our hearts are too far sundered to ever be one.~
@838  = ~Forgive me if I speak to thee no more of love, for I do choose, in despite of mine own affections, not to love thee.~
@839  = ~'Twould be sinful folly.~
@840  = ~Thou shouldst think more deeply of this. Marriage is a serious prospect for those of our ages.~
@841  = ~Why? Is't that thou doth not think marriage sacred? Or that the punishments of the Planes are too stringent for the Prime?~
@842  = ~I don't think marriage is as valuable as a *life*.~
@843  = ~The punishment is too harsh, despite the gravity of the offense.~
@844  = ~At least thou dost see the depth of the guilt. (Saerileth sighs.) To betray the one to whom thou hast sworn thy life--'tis unspeakable!~
@845  = ~(Saerileth's face remains grave, and she is silent for a long while.)~
@846  = ~That is where thou art mistaken, <CHARNAME>. When a man and a woman wed, each gives up his old life in favor a new, shared life.~
@847  = ~Their old lives are gone, and only the shared one remains. 'Tis what it means to be married. 'Tis the meaning and outworking of the marriage vow.~
@848  = ~And this life is destroyed by the betrayal of the vow. To take the life of the betrayer is but to loose the hold of death on the remaining one.~
@849  = ~'Tis hard, perhaps, for thee to see. To dwell on Mount Celestia is to be ever in the light of the glory of the gods.~
@850  = ~Such ideas as a single, shared life between two people, a life created by a vow, are not strange to us.~
@851  = ~Ideas are unseen realities, ones that can alter the shape of the seen.~
@852  = ~Aye, the conjoining of two who love is a supreme blessing. (Saerileth nods vigorously.)~
@853  = ~The three-fold purposes of marriage, to bring forth children, to provide mutual help and comfort, and to preserve chastity, are all of equal import and value, but oh--the joy of a shared love!~
@854  = ~Does that mean a marriage which fails to produce children is cause for divorce?~
@855  = ~I don't think they're of equal importance. The most important part is being with the one you love.~
@856  = ~There are many who wouldst agree with thee. (Saerileth is untroubled by the admission and continues to smile as she speaks.)~
@857  = ~But all are valuable parts. A full marriage hast them all.~
@858  = ~I agree that they are all important.~
@859  = ~I don't think marriage is even necessary. You can love without it, and that is all that matters.~
@860  = ~But what happens if you don't stay in love?~
@861  = ~(Saerileth's eyes grow wide, and she stops to turn and look into your eyes.)~
@862  = ~How can love end without the consent of the will? Love is an act of will, not an emotion.~
@863  = ~If thou dost *choose* to love, then there is naught that can alter it.~
@864  = ~I disagree. Without that "spark" what is there? It's just the empty form of a relationship.~
@865  = ~It's better to end a relationship that is empty and loveless.~
@866  = ~Yes, love is an act of the will.~
@867  = ~Heardst thou not my words? Love doth "end", nor doth its flame die without the will of those who love.~
@868  = ~Then what is there to fear? Love cannot end with our consent.~
@869  = ~(Saerileth smiles up at you, her eyes shining with a deep blue light.)~
@870  = ~I am glad that in this at least thou and I are in accord.~
@871  = ~Aye, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished! (Saerileth nods vigorously.) The conjoining of two who love is a supreme blessing.~
@872  = ~What? (Saerileth's face is paler than alabaster, and she stops still, twisting her hands together.)~
@873  = ~Speak'st thou from thy heart?~
@874  = ~Yes, Saerileth. Marriage is just an empty formality. Children, companionship--you can have those things without marriage.~
@875  = ~No, Saerileth. I was just seeing if you were listening! (Wink at her.) I believe in marriage with the right girl.~
@876  = ~Yes, Saerileth, I mean it. Marriage isn't for me.~
@877  = ~Thou shouldst not toy so with thy Saerileth, nor shouldst thou speak so of things so grave.~
@878  = ~(Saerileth's face has not yet regained its wonted color.)~
@879  = ~Please, answer me. I wouldst know if thy thought and mine are the one. What is the purpose of marriage?~
@880  = ~Then thou hast all this time deceived me? For I hadst not supposed thou didst but dally with me and mean to wreck me!~
@881  = ~(Saerileth turns her back on you.)~
@882  = ~I never lied to you. I love you, but I don't believe in marriage.~
@883  = ~Sorry, kid, those are the breaks!~
@884  = ~I wouldst never have it believed it of thee, <CHARNAME>!~
@885  = ~(And Saerileth turns from you, her shoulders shaking, but she speaks no more.)~
@886  = ~<CHARNAME>, today is the Feast of Tyr.~ [SAERI077]
@887  = ~Umm--many happy returns?~
@888  = ~What do you do on the Feast of Tyr?~
@889  = ~I didn't know that. What is it like?~
@890  = ~(Saerileth laughs softly.) Ah, nay, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis not so that thou shouldst speak. Sayest thou, May the Blind God keep thee.~
@891  = ~May the Blind God keep thee.~
@892  = ~What else do you do on the Feast of Tyr?~
@893  = ~What does the Feast of Tyr commemorate?~
@894  = ~Aye, just so. I do wish that we could properly keep the Feast, but there is no way.~
@895  = ~Why not?~
@896  = ~There is a celebration at the temple, with much singing and feasting, and it ends with the quenching of the lights.~
@897  = ~(Saerileth's eyes are distant, her voice low.) I can yet see it as it was on Mount Celestia.~
@898  = ~Each follower of Tyr holds a single candle. We wait until there comes the voice of the holy father, saying, "The God of Justice is blind, that justice may be blind.~
@899  = ~Then we do all extinguish our tapers, and we kneel to pray. We remain in our orisons until the dawn cometh.~
@900  = ~I do hope to share it with thee someday.~
@901  = ~The blindness of justice. (Saerileth's eyes are distant, her voice low.) I can yet see it as it was on Mount Celestia.~
@902  = ~For that thy quest can ill spare four and twenty hours to feast, sing, and then to pray.~
@903  = ~Firstly thou dost say, May the Blind God keep thee.~
@904  = ~'Tis most--sacred. Even the words of the greeting do invoke the ever-blessed Tyr. May the Blind God keep thee.~
@905  = ~It is ever a joy to me, <CHARNAME>, to know that thou and I are both paladins in the service of our gods.~ [SAERI078]
@906  = ~To be the Chosen of a god is a great honor, one that I strive daily to merit.~
@907  = ~I, too, am glad that we both share this calling.~
@908  = ~But what about being a Chosen? Isn't that different from a paladin?~
@909  = ~Yes. Even though we serve different gods, we are both still paladins.~
@910  = ~Thou, too, art a Chosen? (Saerileth's eyes are shining with azure light.) I knew it not!~
@911  = ~What? You *know* I'm a paladin!~
@912  = ~We've talked about this before. I'm a paladin just like you.~
@913  = ~You mean that being a Chosen is different from being a paladin?~
@914  = ~Aye, a paladin, <CHARNAME>, but a Chosen is not of necessity a paladin. Indeed, 'tis rare that a paladin is a Chosen One.~
@915  = ~More common is the choice of a deva or some other angel.~
@916  = ~Why are angels usually chosen?~
@917  = ~Didn't you say Lord Edorem was a Chosen?~
@918  = ~Aye, <CHARNAME>, 'tis true. Paladins are not of necessity Chosen. Indeed, 'tis rare that a paladin is a Chosen One.~
@919  = ~For that, a Chosen is set apart to be one day a proxy, a vessel of the god's power in the planes.~
@920  = ~And you're Tyr's Proxy?!~
@921  = ~How is that different from being a paladin? They're both vessels of their god's power.~
@922  = ~How many Chosen does Tyr have?~
@923  = ~Aye, Lord Edorem is a Chosen of Tyr. He and I are the only Chosen that I know. Tyr hath had two full proxies, but he hath of late lost one.~
@924  = ~How does a god "lose" a proxy?~
@925  = ~So this is a great honor?~
@926  = ~At least we share paladinhood, at any rate.~
@927  = ~Nay, not yet. Someday, if I do not ere then die, I am to be.~
@928  = ~Lord Edorem and I are the only Chosen that I know. Tyr hath had two full proxies, but he hath of late lost one.~
@929  = ~A paladin is a holy warrior, a vessel after the fashion of a priest. A proxy speaks the words of his god and doth his god's will only.~
@930  = ~Through death. (Saerileth's cobalt eyes flood suddenly.) All servants of Tyr do yet mourn the loss of Konas Wyrmslayer.~
@931  = ~An honor I can never deserve. (Saerileth smiles and kisses your cheek.)~
@932  = ~But I must learn to brook receiving that which I do not deserve, for I have received thy love.~
@933  = ~Aye. And to have thy love is an honor beyond my deserving. (Shyly, Saerileth smiles.) I shouldst have loved thee whatever thy calling, but that thou and I do share paladinhood--~
@934  = ~(Saerileth kisses you rather than finishing her sentence.)~
@935  = ~The lot of a paladin--and more especially a Chosen!--is oft a lonely one, and I am ever grateful for thee.~
@936  = ~I strive daily to deserve the honor of being a Chosen.~
@937  = ~So, Chosen and paladins are different?~
@938  = ~(Kiss Saerileth.) Tyr chose an angel when he chose you.~
@939  = ~Nay, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis true that angels, deva, or planetars are more oft Chosen than are mortals, but I *am* a human.~
@940  = ~So you mean Chosen and paladins are different?~
@941  = ~Why are mortals usually not Chosen?~
@942  = ~I thank thee, <CHARNAME>. It is good to feel welcome.~
@943  = ~Aye, thou seest the right of it.~
@944  = ~From thence came I to the Prime, to Toril.~
@945  = ~(Saerileth rebinds her hair more tightly.)~
@946  = ~(Saerileth smiles.) I have never cut it, and when I loose it, it falls to my knees.~
@947  = ~'Twould be dishonesty in me if I didst not tell thee that 'twas the command of Maimed Tyr that I bear his symbol on my brow.~
@948  = ~'Twas perhaps misleading to speak of a "tale".~
@949  = ~(Saerileth catches herself up.) Tyr does not choose many for his paladins, but 'tis not out merit his eye seeks out.~
@950  = ~I am humbled that ever-blessed Tyr deigned to call me.~
@951  = ~Thou art too kind, <CHARNAME>, truly. 'Tis no merit of mine but the grace of Tyr.~
@952  = ~(Saerileth laughs.) 'Tis my unpracticed speech that mars my tale.~
@953  = ~Oh. (Saerileth seems suddenly shaken.) Forgive me. I will not trouble thee now.~
@954  = ~I'm sorry. I would rather like to hear your tale.~
@955  = ~Maybe later, when there's more time.~
@956  = ~As thou wilt.~
@957  = ~I would help thee, if I could.~
@958  = ~(Saerileth smiles, but the gravity remains in her eyes.) I would help thee, if I could.~
@959  = ~I do pity thee, <CHARNAME>. Thy destiny is a hard one.~
@960  = ~At times the demands of justice are difficult.~
@961  = ~Of course. Forgive me my thoughtlessness.~
@962  = ~I knew it not. I would never have spoken had I known.~
@963  = ~Nevertheless, I do ask thy forgiveness.~
@964  = ~Aye, as thou wouldst have it.~
@965  = ~He loved thee.~
@966  = ~'Tis difficult for thee. Wilt thou speak more of thy father to me?~
@967  = ~Books are friends that never leave.~
@968  = ~The weapons of a warrior are ever his trusted friends.~
@969  = ~And now thy music is a friend also to thy companions.~
@970  = ~I do hope that thou canst find a home there will never be cause for thee to leave.~
@971  = ~Thou must needs then find a new home.~
@972  = ~Then wherever thy home may be, the birds and beasts shall be welcome.~
@973  = ~<CHARNAME>, tonight is the Feast of Tyr.~ [SAERI077]
@974  = ~Who taught thee the ways of war, <CHARNAME>?~ [SAERI079]
@975  = ~I learned from anyone in and around Candlekeep who could teach me.~
@976  = ~No-one. I just kind of picked it up.~
@977  = ~The captain of the guard at Candlekeep.~
@978  = ~I've always had a natural talent for fighting, but it really developed when I started adventuring.~
@979  = ~Thou art most skilled for one who had no formal instruction.~
@980  = ~I try. (Wink.)~
@981  = ~That sounds a bit patronizing.~
@982  = ~Thanks.~
@983  = ~(Saerileth chuckles good-naturedly.) Thy business is bloodshed, and yet thou art merry.~
@984  = ~Then thou hath mistook my meaning. I meant it for praise.~
@985  = ~Warriors who lack private training under a sole master rarely excel as thou.~
@986  = ~Thou art most welcome, <CHARNAME>. The study of war hath not driven from thee graciousness.~
@987  = ~He must have been a puissant warrior, if thy prowess is any way due to him.~
@988  = ~It certainly is. I was slow at learning the ways of battle.~
@989  = ~It certainly is. I was impatient to learn, but he taught me that patience is sometimes a warrior's greatest strength.~
@990  = ~Not at all. His instruction profited me little, for I soon surpassed him.~
@991  = ~Not at all. He was a fool who quickly abandoned my training when he realized I had surpassed him.~
@992  = ~He was a great warrior, and I owe him much.~
@993  = ~There is no present sign of slowness in thee. But thou dost great honor to thy former master to remember him fondly.~
@994  = ~'Tis a lesson thou hast well learned. But thou dost great honor to thy former master to remember him fondly.~
@995  = ~Modesty would better become thee, <CHARNAME>.~
@996  = ~Modesty becomes thee, <CHARNAME>. Thou dost great honor to thy former master to remember him fondly.~
@997  = ~That I can well believe. Much practice hath honed thy skill to near-perfection.~
@998  = ~Thank you, Saerileth, but I still have much to learn.~
@999  = ~You're right: I am just about as perfect as one can get!~
@1000 = ~I do not need your flattery!~
@1001 = ~Modesty becomes thee, <CHARNAME>.~
@1002 = ~(Saerileth's face becomes grave.) The road that thou dost tread is fraught with such danger that thou wilt not lack opportunity to learn.~
@1003 = ~I meant no flattery, but courtesy. That thou knowest not the difference sheweth thy churlishness.~
@1004 = ~I do greatly admire thy discipline, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis a difficult road thou dost tread.~ [SAERI080]
@1005 = ~Umm--aren't you a paladin? Don't you have a narrower path than mine?~
@1006 = ~And as a paladin you would be able to appreciate that.~
@1007 = ~It is difficult, but it is worth it.~
@1008 = ~It's not so hard. This is my natural path.~
@1009 = ~(Saerileth nods.) Aye, the path of a paladin is strait, I grant thee. Still, we do not merely choose our path.~
@1010 = ~We are called into it. Thou chosest freely to be a monk.~
@1011 = ~Yes, and I don't regret it. It's a rewarding path.~
@1012 = ~It wasn't so much a free choice as the natural outgrowth of my talents.~
@1013 = ~I see that it is so. I have seen thy discipline and its fruit in thy character. Thou art most strong of will.~
@1014 = ~'Tis necessary for thee to fight thy father's taint. Perhaps this is the mercy of the gods upon thee.~
@1015 = ~(Saerileth falls silent, thinking deeply on this aspect of your heritage.)~
@1016 = ~Thou art wise to follow the giftings of the gods. 'Tis ever best to do that for which thou hast the heart.~
@1017 = ~I can indeed. Yet as a paladin I did not merely choose my path; I wast called into it. Thou chosest freely to be a monk.~
@1018 = ~All things worth obtaining are difficult. Yet though thy path is harder than most, thou chosest freely to be monk.~
@1019 = ~As you said, the harder the task, the more valuable the result. I wanted to be my own master.~
@1020 = ~(Saerileth nods.) I can understand that. For me, too, my path, though strait, is not burdensome to me.~
@1021 = ~Yet for paladins there is less an element of choice in what we do, for we are called unto our path. Thou chosest freely to be a monk.~
@1022 = ~I want and desire discipline. I need it; that is why I am a monk.~
@1023 = ~Thou art a warrior of righteousness and truth, <CHARNAME>. In whose name dost thou fight?~ [SAERI081]
@1024 = ~I follow Helm.~
@1025 = ~I serve Torm.~
@1026 = ~I am a servant of Lathander.~
@1027 = ~I am a knight of the Ruby Rose, follower of Sune Firehair.~
@1028 = ~I suffer in Ilmater's name.~
@1029 = ~Do you not know? I follow Tyr, as you do!~
@1030 = ~I am a guardian of the Weave, servant of Mystra.~
@1031 = ~I honor all the gods of goodness.~
@1032 = ~I thought I had seen in thine actions the tenets of the Watcher.~
@1033 = ~Tell me, why dost thou serve as a paladin a god who places the law above the good?~
@1034 = ~Because it is good to obey the law.~
@1035 = ~Because sometimes man's good intentions are not good enough. The law is necessary for order.~
@1036 = ~I only follow *good* laws.~
@1037 = ~Because the Watcher called me to his service.~
@1038 = ~But not all laws are just, <CHARNAME>. As a paladin, thou must be prepared to judge between the just and the unjust, even when it comes to laws.~
@1039 = ~Wouldst thou have an unjust order? Certainly not, for thou art a paladin.~
@1040 = ~Which wilt thou choose when the choice must be made: goodness or order?~
@1041 = ~So thou hast seen the choice that must be made: that between goodness and order.~
@1042 = ~Well hast thou chosen.~
@1043 = ~Like me, thou hast heard the call of thy god. Thou art blessed.~
@1044 = ~Then thou and I art kin, and I embrace thee in Tyr's and Torm's names.~
@1045 = ~Torm hath honored thee by his call, and thou art a creature of duty and obedience.~
@1046 = ~Yes, I am, and I am proud to be so.~
@1047 = ~But I do not preach *blind* obedience.~
@1048 = ~I serve Torm with my utmost obedience and will do all he requires of me.~
@1049 = ~May Torm safeguard thy life and aid thee in thy struggle against the murderous lure of thy blood.~
@1050 = ~Thou art wise to know the difference, <CHARNAME>.~
@1051 = ~Yet the wisdom of the gods--the wisdom of Torm--is far beyond our scope. Their commands may at times seem nonsense, but they know far more than we, and we should obey.~
@1052 = ~Even blindly.~
@1053 = ~Then thou and I art kin, and I embrace thee in Tyr's and Lathander's names.~
@1054 = ~Lathander hath honored thee by his call. Dost thy love of the dawn and the renewal of life war with thy heritage of death?~
@1055 = ~Yes, I struggle daily in that conflict.~
@1056 = ~Yes, sometimes, when I am in the thick of battle and blood flows all around me.~
@1057 = ~No, my love for Lathander's light has purged from me my father's lust for death.~
@1058 = ~No, I renounced my heritage when I came to be in the Morninglord's service.~
@1059 = ~Then may the blessed light of the Morninglord fully drive the darkness from thy heart.~
@1060 = ~I will pray to Tyr for thee as well.~
@1061 = ~Thou art most fortunate, and the grace of the Morninglord doth rest upon thee.~
@1062 = ~I praise Tyr for thee!~
@1063 = ~An unusual choice for a paladin, yet one that I admire.~
@1064 = ~Dost thy romantic disposition war with thy heritage of death?~
@1065 = ~No, my love for all that is beautiful has purged from me the ugliness of death.~
@1066 = ~No, I renounced my heritage when I came to be in the service of the Lady of the Ruby Rose.~
@1067 = ~Then may the love of Sune Firehair fully drive the darkness from thy heart.~
@1068 = ~Thou art most fortunate, and the grace of Sune Firehair doth rest upon thee.~
@1069 = ~Then thou and I art kin, and I embrace thee in Tyr's and Ilmater's names.~
@1070 = ~I do greatly admire the addition of mercy to justice that is the way of the Crying God. Suffering purges, but thou dost take the purging upon thyself, suffering that others need not.~
@1071 = ~You're right, Saerileth. That is always what I strive for.~
@1072 = ~Not exactly. I embrace martyrdom and suffering because they cleanse *me*.~
@1073 = ~The Crying God called, and I answered. That is all.~
@1074 = ~'Tis certain then that thou shalt succeed. May the mercy of the Weeping God give thee strength to endure.~
@1075 = ~Thine own purity is a prize worth seeking. May the mercy of the Weeping God give thee strength to endure.~
@1076 = ~Thou art most obedient to a hard task, and the mercy of the Crying God doth rest upon thee.~
@1077 = ~I had hoped that 'twas so, but I did not wish to deceive myself, should perhaps mine eyes have mistaken.~
@1078 = ~It doth my heart good to meet here a <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> in Tyr's service! Why didst *thou* choose to follow the Blind God?~
@1079 = ~I didn't. He chose me.~
@1080 = ~I fight for justice, and the Maimed God dispenses it.~
@1081 = ~Why did *you*? Whom else is there to serve?~
@1082 = ~And that his power doth rest on thee is plain. (Saerileth's face darkens.) 'Tis hard that thou, a servant of Tyr, must fight against thine own blood for justice.~
@1083 = ~I will pray the Maimed God to defend thee from the darkness of thy lineage, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.~
@1084 = ~Aye. (Saerileth's face darkens.) 'Tis hard that thou, a servant of Tyr, must fight against thine own blood for justice.~
@1085 = ~Whom indeed? (Saerileth laughs, but then her face grows grave.) 'Tis hard that thou, a servant of Tyr, must fight against thine own blood for justice.~
@1086 = ~The Lady of the Weave? (Saerileth's eyes are wide.) 'Tis an unusual choice for a paladin, <CHARNAME>.~
@1087 = ~Hast thou thought what thou wilt do when thou shalt meet again thy foe Irenicus?~
@1088 = ~He is not only thy tormentor and Imoen's, but he abuseth Mystra's Weave for his own purposes.~
@1089 = ~When I meet him, I will kill him for the sake of the Mistress of the Weave!~
@1090 = ~Irenicus will die slowly! He deserves no less than torture for what he has done!~
@1091 = ~I haven't thought about it yet. It doesn't do to borrow trouble.~
@1092 = ~'Tis to thy credit that thine own wrongs do not blind thee when thy very blood must cry out for vengeance.~
@1093 = ~I will pray the Maimed God to keep thee in this struggle.~
@1094 = ~Take care, <CHARNAME>, that thine own wrongs do not blind thee to the will of thy goddess.~
@1095 = ~I will pray the Maimed God to grant thee wisdom in this struggle.~
@1096 = ~Thou art wise, <CHARNAME>. 'Tis to thy credit that thine own wrongs do not blind thee when thy very blood must cry out for vengeance.~
@1097 = ~(Saerileth laughs lightly.) Ah, <CHARNAME>, the Prime is most backward then, to think that all the gods together do give to thee thy powers.~
@1098 = ~Thou hast been called to be a paladin by a single god, and 'tis he who blesses thee with his powers.~
@1099 = ~Well, I've never figured out who it is.~
@1100 = ~Do you have any ideas who it might be?~
@1101 = ~'Tis strange that he hath not yet revealed himself to thee. Perhaps he will in time.~
@1102 = ~(Saerileth's eyes are soft as she looks at you.) I do pity thee that thou knowest not yet thy lord.~
@1103 = ~I? (Saerileth tilts her head to the left.) I do not sense the grace of Tyr in thee, but yet thou art not so far from it.~
@1104 = ~Perhaps 'tis Torm who hath called thee to his service. He doth serve Tyr, and 'twould explain the kinship I feel to thee.~
@1105 = ~I thought I had seen in thine actions the tenets of the Watcher, my lovely one.~
@1106 = ~(Saerileth whispers to herself.) He of the Unsleeping Eyes must be pleased by thy beauty.~
@1107 = ~(She speaks again to you directly.) Tell me, why dost thou serve as a paladin a god who places the law above the good?~
@1108 = ~But I have no doubts of thy judgement, sweet one.~
@1109 = ~Which wilt thou choose when the choice must be made: goodness or order? But I have no doubts of thy judgement, sweet one.~
@1110 = ~Well hast thou chosen. (Saerileth smiles sweetly at you, her blue eyes resting with pleasure on your face.)~
@1111 = ~Like me, thou hast heard the call of thy god. Thou art blessed. (Saerileth smiles sweetly at you, her blue eyes resting with pleasure on your face.)~
@1112 = ~Then thou and I art kin, and I embrace thee in Tyr's and Torm's names. (Saerileth suits her actions to the words and places her arms around you.)~
@1113 = ~I pray that I may ever be at thy side to aid thee in it, as well.~
@1114 = ~Thou art wise to know the difference, <CHARNAME>. (Saerileth's cobalt eyes rest gravely on your face.)~
@1115 = ~Then thou and I art kin, and I embrace thee in Tyr's and Lathander's names. (Saerileth suits her actions to the words and places her arms around you.)~
@1116 = ~(Saerileth murmurs these words as she turns.) And I pray that I may ever be at thy side to aid thee in it, as well.~
@1117 = ~I praise Tyr for thee! (Saerileth impulsively kisses your cheek before returning to her place.)~
@1118 = ~An unusual choice for a paladin, yet one that I admire. (Saerileth's cobalt eyes are brilliant, but her cheeks are flushed.)~
@1119 = ~Then thou and I art kin, and I embrace thee in Tyr's and Ilmater's names. (Saerileth suits her actions to the words and places her arms around you.)~

@1127 = ~And may he grant that I may be ever at thy side to aid thee and to bear thy burdens for thee so far as I am able.~
@1128 = ~(Saerileth's eyes are soft as she looks at you, and she takes your hand.) I do pity thee that thou knowest not yet thy lord.~
@1129 = ~Yet may Blind Tyr grant that I may be ever at thy side to aid thee.~
@1130 = ~(Saerileth blushes and takes your hand, caressing it.)~
@1131 = ~Didst thou know, <CHARNAME>, that mine own brother is also a ranger?~ [SAERI082]
@1132 = ~No, I didn't know that, Saerileth. Please tell me about him.~
@1133 = ~No, I didn't know, and I don't care to.~
@1134 = ~Yes, I knew that. You have mentioned him before.~
@1135 = ~I believe you have mentioned him before, but I did not know he was a ranger.~
@1136 = ~His name is Tal, and he doth reside on the slopes of Mount Celestia.~
@1137 = ~He is the guardian of the Forest of Morath on the shores of Everspring, and thou dost call him to my mind.~
@1138 = ~How?~
@1139 = ~It's nice to remember family members.~
@1140 = ~I trust this remembrance is a good thing.~
@1141 = ~In thy love of Nature and thy protection of the natural world.~
@1142 = ~And also that thou and he can both approach wild animals and tame and befriend them.~
@1143 = ~I miss Tal, but thy presence comforts me in my absence from him.~
@1144 = ~'Tis a bittersweet pleasure to remember mine absent brother.~
@1145 = ~It is. I love my brother Tal dearly, and I miss him; but thy presence comforts me in my absence from him.~
@1146 = ~Forgive <CHARNAME> my ever-active tongue. I will speak of him no more.~
@1147 = ~He is often in my thoughts, and it is no surprise that I wouldst speak of him.~
@1148 = ~Indeed, he is the guardian of the Forest of Morath on the shores of Everspring, and thou dost call him to my mind.~
@1149 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am most concerned by what I have seen in thee. Surely mine eyes are deceived. Thou art not a thief?~ [SAERI083]
@1150 = ~I follow the sneaksman's trade, yes.~
@1151 = ~A thief? Such a nasty word. I prefer "knight of the post". (Wink at Saerileth.)~

@1153 = ~But for what purpose dost thou employ this trade? Art thou a simple brigand?~
@1154 = ~Yeah, I'm a brigand! Watch your purse, Saerileth!~
@1155 = ~Of course not! I'm an honorable man.~
@1156 = ~Of course not! I'm an honorable <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@1157 = ~It's none of your business. You're not the judge of me!~
@1158 = ~I hadst not thought this of thee. I was the more deceived.~
@1159 = ~I shall not watch only my purse but thy actions, <CHARNAME>. Do not fall into evil.~
@1160 = ~(Saerileth smiles in relief.) I knew my love for thee was not misplaced!~
@1161 = ~(Saerileth smiles in relief.) I knew my trust in thee was not misplaced!~
@1162 = ~My love for thee had made it mine affair. Yet I see now that I was deceived in thee.~
@1163 = ~Thou hast broken my heart, <CHARNAME>.~
@1164 = ~Then I shall watch thy actions. Do not fall into evil, <CHARNAME>.~
@1165 = ~Thy jesting is misplaced, and I am not amused. Art thou indeed a mere brigand and cutpurse?~
@1166 = ~(Saerileth smiles in relief.) Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I had begun to doubt thine honor. Thou art then not a brigand?~
@1167 = ~Thou art one of the holy priests, <CHARNAME>. Tell me more of the god whom thou dost serve.~ [SAERI084]
@1168 = ~It suits thee, <CHARNAME>. Dost thy romantic disposition war with thy heritage of death?~
@1169 = ~The Lady of the Weave? (Saerileth's eyes are wide.) 'Tis strange that thou hast become a priest and not a mage, <CHARNAME>.~
@1170 = ~Thou hast been called to be a priest by a single god, and 'tis he who blesses thee with his powers.~
@1171 = ~Thou art one of the holy priests, <CHARNAME>. Tell me more of the god whom thou dost serve.~ [SAERI085]
@1172 = ~I honor all the gods of neutrality.~
@1173 = ~Tell me, dost thou not find it difficult to follow the law when it runs counter to the good?~
@1174 = ~Because the Watcher called me to his service. I have become as he would have me to be.~
@1175 = ~'Tis strange for me to think that a priest couldst love the law above the good.~
@1176 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I wast raised amongst the holy fathers in the service of Tyr.~
@1177 = ~Aye, but is order an end in itself? Is't not rather a means to an end?~
@1178 = ~Thy stewardship of Nature is praiseworthy, <CHARNAME>.~ [SAERI086]
@1179 = ~Thanks, but I don't do it to please you.~
@1180 = ~Thanks, but I don't do it for the praise.~
@1181 = ~Thank you. I only hope I can serve Nature with the fervor you show in Tyr's service.~
@1182 = ~Of course it is! Serving Nature is the highest calling.~
@1183 = ~(Saerileth flushes up to the roots of her hair.) I meant not to imply such a thing, <CHARNAME>.~
@1184 = ~The path of thy life is not given to me to judge. Forgive my presumption.~
@1185 = ~'Tis precisely why it is praiseworthy. Thy humility suits thy calling.~
@1186 = ~You seem to know a lot about druids for a paladin.~
@1187 = ~(Grin.) Aww, stop it. You're making me blush.~
@1188 = ~My brother Tal is a ranger, which is in some ways like to druid. 'Tis from him that I know aught that I do of Nature or of druids.~
@1189 = ~Thy lightheartedness is ever a pleasure, <CHARNAME>.~
@1190 = ~Thy words do me too much honor, <CHARNAME>. I do serve Tyr with all my heart, yet ever would I serve him more.~
@1191 = ~Thy words are humble, and thy humility suits thy calling.~
@1192 = ~Service in itself is a worthy calling.~
@1193 = ~(Saerileth narrows her eyes as she continues.) Still, be aware that there are other callings besides thine.~
@1194 = ~(Saerileth does not seem disposed for further conversation.)~
@1195 = ~Thy gift, <CHARNAME>, for magic makes thee in a way like unto a priest.~ [SAERI087]
@1196 = ~Thou dost call upon power within thee.~
@1197 = ~But a priest's power comes from his god, which is without.~
@1198 = ~A priest's power is within, for sure, but it is also without. I need no god to aid me.~
@1199 = ~Or a paladin. (Wink at Saerileth.)~
@1200 = ~And within. For the power of the gods is both within and without us, transcending what we mortals can know.~
@1201 = ~Well, my power is not something I cannot understand. Knowledge is power.~
@1202 = ~Granted. And that is where the likeness ends. I comprehend that which gives me my power.~
@1203 = ~As one who hails from the outer planes, I understand this concept well. But the desire for power is a dangerous one, a flirtation with damnation.~
@1204 = ~I did not say the gods are impossible to understand. They are mysterious, but if thy faith is sufficient, then they will show themselves to thee.~
@1205 = ~'Tis folly to deny any need for the gods. Even thine own power is something mysterious, a gift from the gods.~
@1206 = ~No, it is only the gift of my blood.~
@1207 = ~Thou shouldst be wary, <CHARNAME>. Pride is ever the first step toward a fall.~
@1208 = ~Aye, like a paladin. (Saerileth smiles at your humor.)~
@1209 = ~Both paladins and priests draw their power from the gods, who are both without and within us, transcending what we mortals can know.~
@1210 = ~I agree. I am just glad to have been given this gift.~
@1211 = ~Thou art wise to maintain humility. May the gods grant that thou doth never lose it.~
@1212 = ~I foresee that thou wilt become great in Faerun, that thy name will be remembered for many generations, for the path to true power lies in the arcane arts.~ [SAERI088]
@1213 = ~This doesn't sound like you, Saerileth. (Narrow your eyes at her.)~
@1214 = ~I certainly hope so. I plan to make a name for myself!~
@1215 = ~I do not use my powers for personal gain but to help those weaker than I.~
@1216 = ~I do not wish to make a name for myself but to do what is right.~
@1217 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>. This is not an attempt at deceit but to know thy mind.~
@1218 = ~Then know that I plan to make a name for myself!~
@1219 = ~Then know that I do not use my powers for personal gain but to help those weaker than I.~
@1220 = ~Then know that I do not wish to make a name for myself but to do what is right.~
@1221 = ~I hope those weaker than thou are not thy stepping stones to personal glory.~
@1222 = ~<CHARNAME>, thou art a good steward of the gifts thou hast been given. It pleaseth me to travel alongside thee.~
@1223 = ~Come, <CHARNAME>, we will hear that song again!~ [SAERI089]
@1224 = ~What song?~
@1225 = ~Saerileth, I cannot be singing every moment of the day. I've got adventuring to do.~
@1226 = ~A reprise, then? An encore?~
@1227 = ~Are you mocking me?~
@1228 = ~Thou hast sung it often, the lyric by Daehan, whom thou dost claim is one of Faerun's finest bards.~
@1229 = ~Oh, "Under the Greenwood Tree"?~
@1230 = ~Oh, "He is Dead and Gone"?~
@1231 = ~Oh, "My Love is as a Fever"?~
@1232 = ~Oh, "Where the Bee Sucks"?~
@1233 = ~Yes, indeed. Thou hast remembered it! (And Saerileth waits expectantly.)~
@1234 = ~Then sit you by awhile and listen:
Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me
And turn his merry note
Unto the sweet bird's throat
Come hither, come hither, come hither!
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter and rough weather.~
@1235 = ~Then sit you by awhile and listen:
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead;
Go to thy deathbed;
He never will come again.
His beard was as white as snow,
All flaxen was his poll.
He is gone, he is gone,
And we cast away moan.
God 'a'mercy on his soul!~
@1236 = ~Then sit you by awhile and listen:
My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please.
My reason, the physician to my love,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
Desire is death, which physic did except.
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
At random from the truth vainly expressed:
 For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
 Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.~
@1237 = ~Then sit you by awhile and listen:
Where the bee sucks, there suck I,
In a cowslip's bell I lie;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat's back I do fly
After summer merrily.
Merrily, merrily shall I live now,
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.~
@1238 = ~'Tis a poignant song in the mouth of one whose enemies are legion.~
@1239 = ~I understand why thou dost seek escape in thy songs.~
@1240 = ~(Saerileth bows her head in reverence to the dead. She does not speculate on who might be the subject of that song.)~
@1241 = ~I pray that none may have reason to regret love for my sake.  Oh, heavy burden!~
@1242 = ~Thy pastoral themes are beautiful and evocative. I can almost see the green hills, so carefully crafted is thy song!~
@1243 = ~Then perhaps when we set camp. Till then, I shall have to content myself with humming thy tunes!~
@1244 = ~Aye, so. One that thou hast sung often, the lyric by Daehan, whom thou dost claim is one of Faerun's finest bards.~
@1245 = ~Nay, indeed! Thy songs are like wings on a weary road. Wilt thou not sing a tune by Daehan, whom thou dost claim is one of Faerun's finest bards.~
@1246 = ~Not now, Saerileth. *I* am weary.~
@1247 = ~Why dost thou serve two gods, Aerie?~ [SAERI090]
@1248 = ~Because my Uncle Quayle taught me to worship Baervan, and Aerdrie Faenya is all that remains to me of my people.~
@1249 = ~I understand thee not. Is't not Corellon Larethian who is the god of thy people?~
@1250 = ~I was once a winged elf, Saerileth. (Aerie's face darkens with remembered pain.)~
@1251 = ~(Saerileth's eyes flood with sympathy, and she presses Aerie's hand.) How--~
@1252 = ~They became infected during my slavery, and my masters sawed them off.~
@1253 = ~How horrible! (Saerileth can say no more, and for long her eyes, filled with pity, rest on the avariel.)~
@1254 = ~Why were you so moved by my past, Saerileth?~
@1255 = ~(Saerileth turns her cobalt gaze full on Aerie.) What dost thou mean? Thy tale was terrible.~ [SAERI091]
@1256 = ~I have been mocked for weakness in the past.~
@1257 = ~Thou art strong, Aerie, for bitterness hast not claimed thy soul. Thou art *good.*~
@1258 = ~It is sweet of you to say so, Saerileth, but not many will share your opinion.~
@1259 = ~More admire thee than thou knowest.~
@1260 = ~Aerie, dost thou have no desire to return to thy home?~ [SAERI092]
@1261 = ~Why do you ask, Saerileth?~
@1262 = ~For that thou wast stolen from thy home. Has thou no wish to see it again?~
@1263 = ~I-I would like to see it, but I c-can't. It can only be reached by flying.~
@1264 = ~Thou hast that power, surely. Thou art a skilled magician.~
@1265 = ~It wouldn't be the same.~
@1266 = ~I am sorry, Aerie. I understand thee not. Why should it not be as it was?~
@1267 = ~Just believe me, Saerileth. I can n-never go back.~
@1268 = ~Were you of noble birth, Saerileth?~
@1269 = ~Aye, sir. My father's name is Arioch, Lord of Everspring. Thou, too, art nobly born, art thou not?~ [SAERI093]
@1270 = ~I am. Upon my father's death I will succeed to the title of Lord Delryn.~
@1271 = ~Hast thou brethren?~
@1272 = ~I have only a sister.~
@1273 = ~(Anomen's eyes take on a spark at the mention of his sister.)~
@1274 = ~The giving of thee to Helm must have been a duty most difficult, then.~
@1275 = ~You don't know what you're talking about!~
@1276 = ~(Anomen's outburst shocks Saerileth into silence, and she watches him thereafter, puzzlement on her face.)~
@1277 = ~What wrong have I done thee? Why dost thou look on me with such disfavor, Squire Anomen?~ [SAERI094]
@1278 = ~I don't!~
@1279 = ~Thou canst not feign that thy look is favorable, Squire.~
@1280 = ~I refuse to talk about this!~
@1281 = ~(Anomen's face is full of fury, but he manages to keep his voice nearly level.)~
@1282 = ~Thy counsel is thine own to keep.~
@1283 = ~(Saerileth returns to her place, uneasy.)~
@1284 = ~Saerileth, I must ask you to forgive my earlier coldness. (Anomen glances uneasily at the ground.)~
@1285 = ~I resented that you had become a knight, while I ten years your senior, was still only a squire.~
@1286 = ~Ah, 'tis of no matter. (Saerileth smiles brightly at Anomen.) And I doubt not that thou wilt be a fine knight.~ [SAERI095]
@1287 = ~I shall strive to, Saerileth. (The burly knight towers over the delicate maid, and he smiles broadly.)~
@1288 = ~Perhaps you could give me some 'instructions'?~
@1289 = ~(Saerileth takes the light, flirtatious words seriously and responds in kind.)~
@1290 = ~Nay, Sir Anomen. I am a Chosen of Tyr, and 'twould not be fitting that I instruct a Knight of Helm.~
@1291 = ~Never mind, Saerileth. (Anomen sighs heavily, then glances at you and chuckles.)~
@1292 = ~Such a child.~
@1293 = ~Saerileth, I can't believe I used to resent you for being a knight!~
@1294 = ~So 'twas for that I had thy disfavor.~ [SAERI096]
@1295 = ~(Anomen laughs harshly.) Well, now you have my pity for it!~
@1296 = ~I do not desire thy pity! 'Tis honor to me to serve the Maimed Tyr!~
@1297 = ~(Saerileth's eyes flash cobalt fire.)~
@1298 = ~I still serve Helm! (The hands of the warrior-priest seek out the haft of his weapon.)~
@1299 = ~I said not that thou hadst forgotten thy god.~
@1300 = ~I said that mine had honored me, and I need no pity!~
@1301 = ~Silence, child! I refuse to listen to a pampered brat!~
@1302 = ~(Saerileth says nothing aloud, but she watches Anomen warily.)~
@1303 = ~So, little dove, you lived in Sigil for a time?~
@1304 = ~Aye.~ [SAERI097]
@1305 = ~And did you find your faction?~
@1306 = ~Nay, Haer'Dalis, nor did I seek such a place of refuge.~
@1307 = ~I was in Sigil only to do the will of Blind Tyr.~
@1308 = ~You missed much then, little one. The Cage has much more to offer than its temples.~
@1309 = ~I missed naught that I would desire.~
@1310 = ~That is only the ignorance of youth.~
@1311 = ~If ever you return there, I can show you much.~
@1312 = ~So, my delicate sparrow, you certainly did not spend all of your time in the temple of Tyr. What of Sigil did you see?~
@1313 = ~I once lost my way in the Hive. At night.~ [SAERI098]
@1314 = ~Fortune smiles upon you, Saerileth. A pretty little thing such as yourself, lost in the Hive, alone. And yet you survived to tell the tale.~
@1315 = ~Fortune had little to do with surviving the Hive.~
@1316 = ~'Twas my first week in the Cage, and I was on an errand from the holy fathers. I did not fully comprehend my danger, though shadows loomed and whispers were all about me.~
@1317 = ~Then a protector? Perhaps you believe Tyr guided and protected you.~
@1318 = ~Tyr guides me always, and his protection is constant. But I believe the answer is simpler. 'Twas ignorance.~
@1319 = ~I do not follow.~
@1320 = ~Boldly I walked the tangled, dark, filth-strewn streets of the Hive; I, a mere child. I knew not my danger, therefore I feared nothing.~
@1321 = ~I escaped unscathed because I had showed more confidence and bravery than I had cause to do.~
@1322 = ~Ah. For one such as you to be in a place like that, it was reasonable to assume you were about the business of your master, and your master was a being of great power.~
@1323 = ~Aye. Had I known my peril, surely I would have been slain.~
@1324 = ~Haer'dalis, there was one place in Sigil in which I found great pleasure.~ [SAERI099]
@1325 = ~Other than the temple? And what place was that?~
@1326 = ~The Great Gymnasium.~
@1327 = ~Ah, my frail flower, even you, a paladin, are not immune to the lure of a hot bath.~
@1328 = ~Nay, indeed. I much enjoyed all that the Ciphers had to offer: the baths, the steam rooms, the exercise field, the massage tables.~
@1329 = ~And to get out of your armor for a while and relax. It must have given you great relief.~
@1330 = ~Aye. Tyr continually communicates his will to me, and the cares of the world oft weigh heavily upon my soul. 'Twas liberating to unburden myself for a short time.~
@1331 = ~And sometimes a girl just needs a nice, long, hot bath.~
@1332 = ~Hast thou ever visited the Plane of Concordant Opposition?~ [SAERI100]
@1333 = ~(Haer'dalis chuckles.) Yes, my dove, and we call it 'the Outlands.'~
@1334 = ~The holy fathers hadst often told me it is an unruly, savage realm. 'Tis the focal point for all the opposing forces in the multiverse.~
@1335 = ~That is true. It is the nexus of all the Outer Planes, and though compared to Mount Celestia the Outlands would appear to be untamed, it is in fact quite orderly, unless one includes the gate towns.~
@1336 = ~Gate towns?~
@1337 = ~At the edge of the Outlands, where they bleed into the Outer Planes, there are the gate towns. Each plane has one, and it is the city which has been built up around the portal leading into its plane.~
@1338 = ~Ribcage, Plague-Mort, Glorium, just to name a few. Each gate town has the characteristics of its home plane.~
@1339 = ~Dost thou mean like Excelsior?~
@1340 = ~Yes, the gate town to your home plane. Not much action there.~
@1341 = ~Indeed. But 'tis a safe place, and Tyr's glory can be seen there.~
@1342 = ~Surely. Of course. Pleasant, indeed...~
@1343 = ~(Saerileth smiles playfully.) I know thou ceaselessly seek'st adventure, Haer'dalis, but there is a time to end thy wanderings.~
@1344 = ~At some time thou must rest.~
@1345 = ~But surely you have heard the old adage: I will sleep when I die.~
@1346 = ~Grey hast thou grown in the service of Torm, Sir Keldorn.~ [SAERI101]
@1347 = ~That is true, Saerileth. I have labored long for him, and I am old now, and weary.~
@1348 = ~But it is my desire to end my days in Torm's service.~
@1349 = ~'Tis certain then that thou shalt, sir, for nor Torm, nor Torm's master, the Maimed God, would deny it you.~
@1350 = ~I would count myself blessed to die in Torm's service, for his cause is just and his quarrels honorable.~
@1351 = ~Sir Keldorn, when didst thou know thy life was Torm's to do with as he list?~ [SAERI102]
@1352 = ~I knew it when I was still a youth. I was perhaps ten years of age when I knew it without doubt.~
@1353 = ~And you?~
@1354 = ~I was but five.~
@1355 = ~That is young indeed. What did your parents say?~
@1356 = ~They were honored greatly by Tyr's blessing and gavest me to the temple of Tyr ere the tenday was out.~
@1357 = ~Did you see them again, Saerileth?~
@1358 = ~Aye, Sir Keldorn. Every tenth day they came to the temple.~
@1359 = ~Your parents must be very devout.~
@1360 = ~Aye, I thank the ever-blessed Tyr they are.~
@1361 = ~Was your father also a paladin, Saerileth?~
@1362 = ~Nay, sir. My father was a magician and my mother a priestess.~ [SAERI103]
@1363 = ~I see.~
@1364 = ~Why is there displeasure in thine eyes, Sir Keldorn? How have I offended thee?~
@1365 = ~(Keldorn smiles at the girl and rests his hand on her shoulder.)~
@1366 = ~No, little Saerileth, you have not offended me. It was disappointment in my eyes.~
@1367 = ~But why, sir?~
@1368 = ~I had once hoped my Leona would follow in Torm's way. She is just your age.~
@1369 = ~'Tis not too late. Torm may yet choose her.~
@1370 = ~No, Saerileth. (The knight's voice is heavy.) I fear it will never be.~
@1371 = ~What sort of druid art thou, Cernd?~ [SAERI104]
@1372 = ~I am a shapeshifter druid.~
@1373 = ~A--but is it not the part of a druid to serve the land? Why dost thou serve lycanthropes?~
@1374 = ~(The druid chuckles.) No, Saerileth. I have a druid grove.~
@1375 = ~It is in Tethyr, and to it my heart turns as the sunflower seeks the sun.~
@1376 = ~Aye, forgive me. I understand. Nature hath gifted thee with the power to change thy form that thou mayest defend thy grove.~
@1377 = ~Exactly so, little one.~
@1378 = ~Canst thou speak to the birds, Cernd?~ [SAERI105]
@1379 = ~Yes, little one, I can.~
@1380 = ~Do they know the glory of the gods? Do they not know at least the thoughts of Chauntea or Silvanus?~
@1381 = ~The thoughts of the birds do not hold the names of the gods, but all of Nature's know her care.~
@1382 = ~Why do you ask?~
@1383 = ~For that I wished to know if a bird in flight didst give thanks even as I give thanks to Tyr when I feel his justice.~
@1384 = ~How long wilt thou journey with <CHARNAME>?~ [SAERI106]
@1385 = ~So long as it serves the Balance.~
@1386 = ~Well I know that thy wisdom canst see the needs of the Balance, but what of thine own desires?~
@1387 = ~What do you mean, little one?~
@1388 = ~If the Balance of Nature didst not require thee here, where wouldst thou go?~
@1389 = ~That is an easy question, Saerileth. I would return to my grove in Tethyr.~
@1390 = ~Is that home for thee?~
@1391 = ~Yes, it is.~
@1392 = ~Edwin, why do the people of the cities where we go avoid thy gaze and fear to cross thy path?~ [SAERI107]
@1393 = ~Because the monkeys know better than to cross a Red Wizard! (As should you.)~
@1394 = ~That thou art a Red Wizard I can see from thy robes, but what are these Red Wizards that they are so dreaded?~
@1395 = ~They are not merely dreaded. They are *feared!*~
@1396 = ~And this gives thee pleasure. (Saerileth's voice is soft with disbelief.)~
@1397 = ~I am proud to be a Red Wizard of Thay. (The baby doesn't understand even this much of Toril! There's no hope for her.)~
@1398 = ~I've heard that magic works differently in the Planes. Have you seen such strange workings with your own eyes?~
@1399 = ~I am no wizard, sir. All magic is to me strange.~ [SAERI108]
@1400 = ~Well, obviously. But surely with your exposure to Sigil and other places you have some passing knowledge on the subject.~
@1401 = ~I know that a spell key is necessary to cast some types of magic on certain planes.~
@1402 = ~For priests, 'tis a power key.~
@1403 = ~Indeed? And these spell keys are difficult to acquire?~
@1404 = ~I know not since I have no need of such things. Doth your interest spring from a desire to go planewalking?~
@1405 = ~It's always a possibility, and knowledge is always power. (Despite what your brainwashing priests might tell you.)~
@1406 = ~Seekest thou knowledge for no other cause?~
@1407 = ~(What spectacular naivete this one displays!) No, child. There is no other cause. Through knowledge comes power.~
@1408 = ~Edwin, what is the purpose of these half-whispered asides? Surely thou must know that they are heard.~ [SAERI109]
@1409 = ~So. I speak the truth these dogs should hear. (Besides, the only way to converse with my intellectual equal is to hold discourse with myself.)~
@1410 = ~Dost thou fear no reprisal?~
@1411 = ~From you?~
@1412 = ~Nay, sir. I am not wounded by thy words.~
@1413 = ~Yet others may be, others who have the means to do thee great injury.~
@1414 = ~Attacking a Red Wizard is a dangerous thing. (She is not wounded by my words? I must be slipping...)~
@1415 = ~'Tis also perilous to make needless enemies.~
@1416 = ~Are you expressing *concern* for me, paladin?~
@1417 = ~Aye, sir. I am.~
@1418 = ~Well, don't! I have no need of a child's protection!~
@1419 = ~Lady Fentan, is't not unusual that thou dost serve Arvoreen?~ [SAERI110]
@1420 = ~Is it not the custom of thy people to serve Yondalla?~
@1421 = ~It is true that many of my people serve Yondalla, but I am a knight.~
@1422 = ~Well I know that Yondalla taketh no knights into her service. 'Twas not this that I questioned.~
@1423 = ~I wished to know *why* thou didst choose Arvoreen and his more warlike ways.~
@1424 = ~Why did you choose to follow Tyr?~
@1425 = ~The Blind God chose me. Wast so with thee?~
@1426 = ~Not precisely.~
@1427 = ~I would hear thy tale, Lady Fentan.~
@1428 = ~Perhaps later.~
@1429 = ~Do you still wish to know why I chose to become a knight?~
@1430 = ~Aye, Lady Fentan.~ [SAERI111]
@1431 = ~When I was eight years old, I went alone to a camp of gypsy traders who came to Trademeet.~
@1432 = ~I saw an Alibakkar guard--the guard of a noble house of Trademeet--beat and rob one of the gypsies.~
@1433 = ~No one else saw this.~
@1434 = ~What then came to pass?~
@1435 = ~The gypsy asked for justice, but no one had seen the deed but I.~
@1436 = ~I tried to speak up, but the Alibakkar nobles refused to allow me to speak to the High Merchant.~
@1437 = ~Did this injustice go unpunished? (Saerileth's voice is thick with horror.)~
@1438 = ~No. A wandering knight who was in our village listened to me and spoke to the High Merchant on my behalf.~
@1439 = ~It was then that I decided to become a knight.~
@1440 = ~And thou art a fine one, Lady Fentan.~
@1441 = ~Saerileth, I have noticed that many people we encounter, and even sometimes our traveling companions, cannot accept either of us as knights.~
@1442 = ~Thou speakst truth, Lady Fentan. Thy perception doth thee credit.~ [SAERI112]
@1443 = ~Does it not bother you? You seem unaffected by the disrespect. We are not typical knights, truly, but our hearts are filled with courage and righteousness.~
@1444 = ~Aye, that is so, and 'tis for this reason that lack of respect toucheth me not.~
@1445 = ~In Tyr's grace I do stand. Why should it injure me that others do not see my heart?~
@1446 = ~You have less pride than I, Saerileth. I am still stung by this.~
@1447 = ~The blessing of Arvoreen is upon thee. Trust that his favor is sufficient for thee.~
@1448 = ~Thank you, Saerileth. I take your words as those spoken by a true friend, and I will remember them.~
@1449 = ~Valygar, I know that others must have asked this of thee ere now, but yet I wish to know.~ [SAERI113]
@1450 = ~What is it, little one?~
@1451 = ~Why dost thou reject the gods?~
@1452 = ~Saerileth, you are too young yet to know why a man would reject the gods.~
@1453 = ~Nay, Valygar. In this thou art mistaken. I have known many who rejected the gods.~
@1454 = ~I have dwelt in Sigil, where there are those who have forsaken the gods of this and every world.~
@1455 = ~There are many reasons why a man would do this. Why dost *thou*?~
@1456 = ~Because I do not need them.~
@1457 = ~Perhaps someday thou wilt.~
@1458 = ~I will take the chance.~
@1459 = ~Valygar, thou seem'st lonely. Hast thou no kin?~ [SAERI114]
@1460 = ~Kin are not the only way to avoid loneliness. A man may also have friends.~
@1461 = ~Yet thou art a man most secret. Dost thou permit thyself friends?~
@1462 = ~It is a fair question, child.~
@1463 = ~Which thou wilt not answer?~
@1464 = ~I am, as you have said, a secret man.~
@1465 = ~Then verily thou hast answered me, Valygar.~
@1466 = ~Saerileth, you asked me earlier about my kin, but you said nothing of yours.~
@1467 = ~Thou didst not ask. (Saerileth smiles teasingly.)~ [SAERI115]
@1468 = ~Yet I will tell thee without the asking. I have three elder brothers, Caladus, Tarin, and Tal.~
@1469 = ~Are they all servants of Tyr?~
@1470 = ~They all pay homage to the Blind God, aye, but they are none of them paladins.~
@1471 = ~Tal is, like thee, a ranger.~
@1472 = ~Is he, too, a private man?~
@1473 = ~Not so much as thou art, for he hath a wife. Indeed, just ere I left Mount Celestia for Sigil, she had borne to him a son.~
@1474 = ~A son and heir.~
@1475 = ~Aye. The line of the Lords of Everspring hast been secured for another generation--said I aught amiss?~
@1476 = ~No, child. But my own line ends with me.~
@1477 = ~I am sorry to hear it. Thou shouldst take a wife.~
@1478 = ~I could not ask it of any woman.~
@1479 = ~Thou thinkst too meanly of thyself, Valygar.~
@1480 = ~What's a wee lassie like you doing out adventuring fer gold?~
@1481 = ~I do not adventure for gold as thou dost, Korgan. I am a servant of Tyr, and I am in this world to do his will only.~ [SAERI116]
@1482 = ~Well, if yer too much of a pain the arse, I can always kill ye! And I will.~
@1483 = ~I have no fear of thee.~
@1484 = ~Maybe ye should.~
@1485 = ~I know that thou might'st kill me, but for all that, I fear thee not.~
@1486 = ~Yer a great fool, Saerileth.~
@1487 = ~Why sayest thou this?~ [SAERI117]
@1488 = ~Because yer not afraid to die!~
@1489 = ~Nor dost thou seem to be. Callest thou thyself a fool?~
@1490 = ~I choose me fights. I know what I can do. And when my time comes, I've set aside enough money to have myself raised.~
@1491 = ~I, too, know what I can do, but my life is in the hand of Tyr to do with as he list. Thus, my death is also by Tyr's will.~
@1492 = ~And yer a fool to give yer life away!~
@1493 = ~Isn't there any other reason to strike your enemies?~
@1494 = ~What meanest thou by this?~ [SAERI118]
@1495 = ~You always cry, 'In Tyr's name I strike thee!'~
@1496 = ~'Tis fitting that I speak thus. Tyr--~
@1497 = ~Bah! Piss on Tyr. I've heard enough about that bastard!~
@1498 = ~Beast! Foul-mouthed, blasphemous fiend! Thy life is forfeit!~
@1499 = ~So <CHARNAME> has taken in yet another waif. What is *your* story, rivvil?~
@1500 = ~That I am a servant of Tyr thou know'st. Tyr's affairs--~ [SAERI119]
@1501 = ~No, not your stupid errand! What do you want with <CHARNAME> in particular? Why do you follow <PRO_HIMHER>?~
@1502 = ~It is the will of Tyr--~
@1503 = ~No more! Your words sicken me, mindless drone of Tyr! Silence!~
@1504 = ~(Saerileth says nothing more, and she looks pityingly on the drow.)~
@1505 = ~I have seen a drow once ere I came to Toril, Viconia. She--~ [SAERI120]
@1506 = ~--could not have seen you, or you would be dead by now.~
@1507 = ~She saw me, but oft in Sigil enmity must be left to speech alone. She wished my death, I grant thee.~
@1508 = ~And how did you annoy her?~
@1509 = ~I serve Tyr and she, Lloth. 'Twas enough.~
@1510 = ~Serving Lolth is enough to earn *my* enmity.~
@1511 = ~Then how have I earned it, I who despise Lloth?~
@1512 = ~I wouldn't waste my hate on you, jalil. You deserve no more than my contempt.~
@1513 = ~I have not merited this, Viconia.~
@1514 = ~(The young paladin's face is crimson, but whether with anger or shame, you could not say.)~
@1515 = ~Every day the sight of your face sickens me more than the day before!~
@1516 = ~Thou art thyself a beautiful woman. Why dost thou resent me--~ [SAERI121]
@1517 = ~--I don't speak of beauty, ssindossa! Your face merely reminds me of your pathetic devotion to that--~
@1518 = ~--Silence! I know what thou wouldst say, and I must warn thee not to take the name of Tyr in vain.~
@1519 = ~(Saerileth's voice is shaking, but her eyes are a calm, deadly blue as she continues.)~
@1520 = ~I cannot endure to hear thee blaspheme, and I will slay thee first.~
@1521 = ~Threats from a babe? (Viconia laughs.) Child, you would find me no easy kill. And as for your Blind God--~
@1522 = ~Viconia, I implore thee: tempt me not! I have no desire to shed thy blood.~
@1523 = ~<CHARNAME>, this has gone on long enough! Tell this mewling infant that she cannot journey with us any longer.~
@1524 = ~I can see that you two are never going to get along. Sorry, Saerileth, but you have to go.~
@1525 = ~I can see that you two are never going to get along. But I need Saerileth, so it looks like you're out, Viconia.~
@1526 = ~You cannot leave quickly enough to suit me! To employ your vernacular: get thee gone!~
@1527 = ~This is thy will, <CHARNAME>, so I go without complaint. Tyr's blessing upon ye both.~
@1528 = ~Enjoy your little playtoy, <CHARNAME>. Be gentle with her when you take her from her cradle and into your bed.~
@1529 = ~(And with a wink at Saerileth, she is gone.)~
@1530 = ~Fool! Elg'caress! I leave you with your child! Enjoy your time watching after your baby paladin.~
@1531 = ~Mistress Jaheira, hast thou e'er seen this herb?~ [SAERI122]
@1532 = ~Yes, child. It is called 'Love-in-Idleness', and it is no herb. It is a flower.~
@1533 = ~'Love-in-Idleness'? What doth it mean?~
@1534 = ~Ah, I've made no study of the meanings of flowers, only their uses.~
@1535 = ~Is not meaning sufficient use?~
@1536 = ~(Jaheira sighs.) Sometimes, child. Sometimes.~
@1537 = ~How long hast thou known <CHARNAME>, Jaheira?~
@1538 = ~I was a friend to Gorion, who raised <CHARNAME>.~
@1539 = ~So thou hast known <PRO_HIMHER> since <PRO_HESHE> was a babe?~
@1540 = ~No, <PRO_HESHE> and I are not so different in age as that.~
@1541 = ~Forgive me. The age even of half-elves is not plain to be read.~
@1542 = ~(Jaheira's tone is sharp as she replies.)~
@1543 = ~<CHARNAME> is an adult, as am I. You shall learn someday.~
@1544 = ~I am no child, Mistress Jaheira. I am a maid!~
@1545 = ~No, you are *not*!~
@1546 = ~(Saerileth is silent, but her eyes dart to your face for a moment, then fall.)~
@1547 = ~What was thy past with <CHARNAME> like, Mistress Jaheira?~ [SAERI123]
@1548 = ~Haven't you asked me this already, child?~
@1549 = ~I did not mean it so. I meant to inquire after thine adventures in <CHARNAME>'s company.~
@1550 = ~Together we fought many battles. <CHARNAME> learned to walk the Road in company with me and Khalid.~
@1551 = ~Who is Khalid?~
@1552 = ~Khalid was my husband, slain by Irenicus! And for that I will have that mage's heart on a platter!~
@1553 = ~(Jaheira's face is white and set.)~
@1554 = ~May justice find him quickly. (Saerileth reaches out to place her hand on Jaheira's, but the determined expression of the druid stops her.)~
@1555 = ~I will be glad to aid thee, Mistress Jaheira, in exacting this justice.~
@1556 = ~Lady Nalia, thy desire to aid those in need is strong. Who taught it thee?~ [SAERI124]
@1557 = ~My father always tried to be a good lord of his lands. He always tried to help the people.~
@1558 = ~So thou learned compassion of him.~
@1559 = ~I hope to be the same sort of noble as he.~
@1560 = ~Thou hast chosen the right path, Lady Nalia.~
@1561 = ~You asked earlier about how I learned to care for the less fortunate.~
@1562 = ~Aye, I did.~ [SAERI125]
@1563 = ~I should have mentioned then that my mother, also, cared for the poor.~
@1564 = ~Where is thy lady mother? Thou spake not of her when thou toldst of thy father remaining in thy castle.~
@1565 = ~My mother is dead. She died of a fever she caught while doing charity work.~
@1566 = ~Then thou must most surely honor her memory.~
@1567 = ~I do. I try to do good in her name.~
@1568 = ~Thou hast chosen then the surest way to honor her.~
@1569 = ~Lady Nalia, thou hast no kin any longer. Hast thou thought what thou wilt do?~ [SAERI126]
@1570 = ~That's a cruel thing to say, Saerileth!~
@1571 = ~I meant only to show my concern for thee. I meant no mockery.~
@1572 = ~I'm sorry. It's just that it's still hard for me. . . .~
@1573 = ~But though thou hast no kin, thou art not poor--~
@1574 = ~Yes, I am. I've lost my inheritance, too.~
@1575 = ~But thou hast friends, and therefore thou art not poor. Nor art thou alone.~
@1576 = ~Thank you, Saerileth. (Nalia smiles at the young paladin.) It's good to hear that sometimes.~
@1577 = ~Thou art merry, Jan.~ [SAERI127]
@1578 = ~And why shouldn't I be? Life's too short to waste it being dull.~
@1579 = ~So long as thy joviality doth not become an empty mask, then thou wilt carry joy with thee.~
@1580 = ~That's like saying I'll be happy so long as I'm happy.~
@1581 = ~Aye, 'twas my word. To choose to be joyous is a difficult path, but a wise one.~
@1582 = ~And is it the path you have chosen?~
@1583 = ~I do not yet aim so high. I hope to in the future, when I have learned to be good.~
@1584 = ~Saerileth, your precocious insight reminds me of my great-aunt on my mother's side, Aunt Fenella.~
@1585 = ~She was much older than you, of course, but even so, you're very much alike.~
@1586 = ~I am--~ [SAERI128]
@1587 = ~She was the wise woman of her village. She was the one people went to for advice and to settle disputes.~
@1588 = ~I am honor--~
@1589 = ~But there was one question even *she* could never settle.~
@1590 = ~And that was?~
@1591 = ~Whether a gnome who lived without turnips would still be a gnome.~
@1592 = ~I understand thee not.~
@1593 = ~Of course not. No one knows the answer.~
@1594 = ~Dost thou cultivate other vegetables apart from turnips?~ [SAERI129]
@1595 = ~What would be the point?~
@1596 = ~Turnips alone wouldst not be--~
@1597 = ~Turnips are the most salubrious of all vegetables!~
@1598 = ~I meant that alone their flavor wouldst not be tasted to advantage.~
@1599 = ~Well, we do grow other things for garnish. But turnips can sustain a gnome all by themselves.~
@1600 = ~Saerileth, you remind me of my Dynaheir.~
@1601 = ~And who is Dynaheir?~ [SAERI130]
@1602 = ~She was my witch! You are not a witch, but you are kind like her.~
@1603 = ~She *was* thy witch? She is no longer?~
@1604 = ~(Minsc's face falls.) Dynaheir is dead because I failed to protect her. She was my witch, I her protector!~
@1605 = ~I am sorry for thee. Such shame must be difficult for one of thine honor to bear.~
@1606 = ~Yes, but Boo comforts me and tells me that I must go on and kick the butt of evil for Dynaheir's sake.~
@1607 = ~He well instructs thee.~
@1608 = ~Minsc, I have seen thee oft lose thyself in the lust of battle.~ [SAERI131]
@1609 = ~Yes, of course! I am able to berserk, and I become a greater warrior! I am able to destroy more evil that way.~
@1610 = ~Aye, 'tis true that thy strength is greater, but thou losest thyself. Thou art no longer in control of thyself.~
@1611 = ~What do you mean, little Saerileth? What are you saying?~
@1612 = ~'Tis dangerous. Thou mayest strike thy friends. Thou mayest deal out death unjustly.~
@1613 = ~Oh no! That's impossible! I fight for goodness!~
@1614 = ~(A sudden glimpse of pity crosses Saerileth's face, and she pats Minsc's hand.)~
@1615 = ~Fight thou, Minsc, for goodness.~
@1616 = ~(She sighs softly as she returns to her place.) May Ilmater show thee mercy.~
@1617 = ~Saerileth, are you on your dajemma?~
@1618 = ~What is a dajemma?~ [SAERI132]
@1619 = ~It is the journey to prove your honor! Boo and I are on ours.~
@1620 = ~Ah, nay, Minsc. If that be a dajemma, then mine is completed. I had to prove mine honor in Sigil.~
@1621 = ~So you did not have to journey?~
@1622 = ~Going to Sigil was itself a journey, for my home is on Mount Celestia.~
@1623 = ~'Twas in Sigil that I had to face Glourkist. He was a foe far beyond my skill, but 'twas a test of my faith.~
@1624 = ~Boo says that you must have won; you are here. So the fight was not too much for you!~
@1625 = ~(Saerileth shakes her head.) Nay, Minsc. The battle was far, far beyond me. But the Proxy of Tyr came to aid me, and I lived.~
@1626 = ~'Tis well that we have rescued thee, Imoen. Long have I desired to meet thee.~ [SAERI133]
@1627 = ~Yeah? It's really nice to be out of that prison. But I wasn't expecting <CHARNAME> to keep such strange company.~
@1628 = ~Strange? What dost thou mean?~
@1629 = ~No, don't take it the wrong way. It's just that the way you talk, where you're from--it's all so unfamiliar.~
@1630 = ~Ah. (Saerileth waves her hand dismissively.) Yet thy <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> is the child of a god, as art thou.~
@1631 = ~Thus, 'tis not strange that a planar should join with <CHARNAME>.~
@1632 = ~Yeah, <PRO_HESHE> always keeps me guessing. (And she winks playfully at Saerileth.)~
@1633 = ~Imoen, it is most admirable in thee that thy heart hath remained unsullied by all thy suffering.~ [SAERI134]
@1634 = ~Forgive me if my words do recall thy pain needlessly.~
@1635 = ~Sometimes it's harder than I make it seem. But if I had let them change me, they would've won.~
@1636 = ~Difficult it may be for thee, yet thou art successful. Never have I seen thine eyes darken with tears or anger.~
@1637 = ~Well, you're not around me all the time. I'm still just a girl.~
@1638 = ~Don't set me up as some kind of paragon of courage and triumph.~
@1639 = ~(Saerileth takes Imoen's hand.) A girl, then. And one who will need friends.~
@1640 = ~I think I just found one.~
@1641 = ~Imoen, thou art a most skilled magician. In thee, magic is used for all that is good.~ [SAERI135]
@1642 = ~But thy mortal foe is also a wizard. Doth that trouble thee, that ye both tread the same path of power?~
@1643 = ~Nope. Magic's just a tool, just like anything else. Irenicus and I have *nothing* in common.~
@1644 = ~It doesn't matter which "path of power" I take, as long as I use my gifts for good.~
@1645 = ~Beneath thy playful show is the pure heart of a wise woman.~
@1646 = ~(Imoen laughs.) There you go again, always making everything so serious, so grave!~
@1647 = ~I was born to speak all matter and no mirth.~
@1648 = ~Well, we'll have to work on that, won't we?~
@1665 = ~Thou and I, Yoshimo, are both strangers in this land.~ [SAERI138]
@1666 = ~That may be, but you are from a far stranger land than I.~
@1667 = ~Indeed. Yet would I know more of thy homeland. What is it?~
@1668 = ~I hail from Kara-Tur, of course. You are one of the few people who does not comment on my accent.~
@1669 = ~To mine ears, all speech here is unfamiliar, thine no more so than the rest.~
@1670 = ~Shall I then speak a familiar word in your ear? (And he winks at Saerileth.)~
@1671 = ~Indeed, no sir! (Saerileth, crimson-cheeked, retreats.)~
@1672 = ~You remind me, Saerileth, of a delicate pink flower we have in Kara-Tur. It is called the "sakura", and its fragility is beautiful.~
@1673 = ~What is its season of blossoming?~ [SAERI139]
@1674 = ~Early spring. And by the time the first rains have fallen, it is gone. But during those brief days, the land is filled with them.~
@1675 = ~And when the rough, spring winds shake the petals from the trees, it is as if pink snow has fallen over the land.~
@1676 = ~It sounds most beautiful. I should like to see such beauty.~
@1677 = ~But I have already likened you to the sakura. There is no need to see the sakura when one has gazed upon your loveliness.~
@1678 = ~(Saerileth's mouth opens in silent protest, and then she quickly distances herself from Yoshimo.)~
@1679 = ~(Yoshimo chuckles knowingly and begins whistling a merry tune to himself.)~
@1680 = ~You're avoiding me, Saerileth.~
@1681 = ~Forgive me. I meant not to offend thee.~ [SAERI140]
@1682 = ~Nor I you. (And he gives her a quick wink.) But tell me of the beauties of Mount Celestia. I have told you of *my* home.~
@1683 = ~Mine ancestral estate lies on the shores of Everspring, a lake of glass which reflects the clear sky like a mirror.~
@1684 = ~To stand by the shore and look into the waters is to fall into blue without beginning or end.~
@1685 = ~Just like your eyes, my delicate flower.~
@1686 = ~Why is it that in the eyes of any other I am but a child, but in thine eyes, I am a maiden to be wooed?~
@1687 = ~I have no intention to woo you. I simply call it as it is: a beautiful girl should be told that she is beautiful.~
@1688 = ~Thou hast avoided my question.~
@1689 = ~Yes, I am skilled in avoidance.~
@1690 = ~--Saerileth, your naive sugary-sweetness sickens me! You are *not* a woman but a child! Do you really believe <CHARNAME> is going to fall for your childish mooning?~
@1691 = ~I dare thee but to breathe upon my love! Forty thousand matrons such as thou could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum!~
@1692 = ~Clever words do not alter facts: you are a child. <CHARNAME> is a man who needs a woman who has lived in the world long enough to know what she wants from it.~
@1693 = ~He needs a woman who will speak with the voice of experience and not the idyllic ramblings of a lovestruck brat!~
@1694 = ~<CHARNAME> needs no direction from his woman. He is a man full able to choose for himself.~
@1695 = ~Moreover, I am no child! I am not so old as thou, but neither is <CHARNAME>.~
@1696 = ~(Saerileth turns to you.) <CHARNAME>, no more words. Let my love speak for me.~
@1697 = ~Saerileth, I accept your love and will not wrong it.~
@1698 = ~Saerileth, you are no child but a maid able to win a man's love.~
@1699 = ~Jaheira is right. You are too young for me or any man to love.~
@1700 = ~Saerileth, I am sorry, but my heart belongs to someone else.~
@1701 = ~(Saerileth throws her arms around your neck and leans her head against your breast.) <CHARNAME>, I adore thee.~
@1702 = ~(Saerileth smiles, pleased, and says no more.)~
@1703 = ~'Twas then the reflection of mine own love that I didst see in thine eyes. Perhaps Mistress Jaheira speaks truth: I am unskilled in the ways of love.~
@1704 = ~Yet I do love thee, whether thou lovest me or no.~
@1705 = ~--Enough! Smile, flirt, bat your eyes! You unschooled lerg, your pathetic attempts to win <CHARNAME> turn my stomach! Your machinations will not draw him into your bed!~
@1706 = ~Thou strumpet! Thinkst thou that my desires are so prurient?~
@1707 = ~You deny that when he looks at you he melts your loins?~
@1708 = ~You deny that the thought of his hands on your breasts causes your nipples to stiffen?~
@1709 = ~You deny that when you sleep you long to feel him lie beside you--or atop you?~
@1710 = ~(The drow's lips curl maliciously as she tosses her head toward <CHARNAME>.)~
@1711 = ~You cannot deny this--~
@1712 = ~(Saerileth, her face flushed deep crimson, bursts into tears. Despite her sobs, however, she manages to speak to Viconia.)~
@1713 = ~Thou common stale! (Saerileth draws a ragged breath.)~
@1714 = ~Think'st thou that one of <CHARNAME>'s goodness could e'er love one such as thou!~
@1715 = ~Thou art an index and prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts!~
@1716 = ~(Unable to go on, Saerileth buries her face in her hands and weeps bitterly.)~
@1717 = ~That was uncalled for, Viconia.~
@1718 = ~Saerileth, be still. There is no need to be ashamed of your own womanhood.~
@1719 = ~Be silent, drow! You shame only yourself with your diatribes!~
@1720 = ~Oh can it, Saerileth! If you can't talk about these kinds of things, you certainly shouldn't be pretending to be an adult.~
@1721 = ~Saerileth, I love thee. Be comforted.~
@1722 = ~Indeed? You criticize me when your lust is inflamed with desire for a child?~
@1723 = ~(Saerileth, still overcome with shame, does not lift her head but takes your hand.)~
@1724 = ~I thank thee, <CHARNAME>.~
@1725 = ~Shame! You dare try to shame me, when it is you whose lust is inflamed with desire for a child!~
@1726 = ~(In utter shock, Saerileth drops her hand from her face. Her weeping instantly stops.)~
@1727 = ~Thou art cruel, <CHARNAME>! The drow hath poisoned thee against me.~
@1728 = ~I am no child! I know mine own heart, and it belongs to <CHARNAME>.~
@1729 = ~--J-just stop your little game, Saerileth! <CHARNAME> is not fooled by your pretenses of innocence, and neither am I!~
@1730 = ~If thou didst know me, Aerie, thou wouldst know that I loathe pretense! I speak naught but what I mean in truth.~
@1731 = ~You may think you know love, but you are only a child! I am a woman grown, one that has known suffering.~
@1732 = ~<CHARNAME> has brought the only l-light into my heavy, earthbound existence. What can you know of despair turning to joy?~
@1733 = ~I admit I do not know thy suffering, but one need not have known darkness to love the light.~
@1734 = ~Aerie, your suffering is pitiable, but I do not love you for it.~
@1735 = ~Aerie, I'm sick of hearing about your suffering! Leave Saerileth alone.~
@1736 = ~'Love the light'? Does that mean you love me, as I love you?~
@1737 = ~Saerileth, you flatter me, but I am not romantically-inclined towards you.~
@1738 = ~There is no need for this.~
@1739 = ~J-just leave me alone!~
@1740 = ~Fine! I will leave you to your little girl.~
@1741 = ~I love thee with all my heart, <CHARNAME>, and I have since first I saw thee.~
@1742 = ~It pleases me to hear that thou dost love me.~
@1743 = ~'Twas then the reflection of mine own love that I didst see in thine eyes. I am unskilled in the ways of love.~
@1744 = ~(Saerileth silently accepts your decree and returns to her place. The smile that was on her face is now gone.)~
@1745 = ~Hast thou e'er thought of this road that we tread?~
@1746 = ~Umm--what do you mean by *that*?~
@1747 = ~Yes, I've thought that this road is in very bad repair.~
@1748 = ~I think that *my* road seems to be forced upon me.~
@1749 = ~I only think about the road enough to keep from getting lost.~
@1750 = ~The road beneath our feet stretcheth forth until the end of the world.~
@1751 = ~Behind us, too, it doth pass into the mists of the past, still echoing with the footsteps of those who have trodden it before us.~
@1752 = ~Where do you come *up* with this?~
@1753 = ~So is our road not our own, but only the continuation of what has gone before us?~
@1754 = ~It is only the romance in your eyes which sees the road so, Saerileth. It is a dull slog, and it never ends.~
@1755 = ~(Saerileth laughs.) 'Tis perhaps only a trick of mine eyes. But it seemeth, truly, that we do carry on the deeds of those have gone before.~
@1756 = ~For good or ill, we are not isolated. Our lives are a part of the tale of the Road. It hath been ere we were, and after our lives have ended, still the Road will go on.~
@1757 = ~(Kiss her.) Silly Saerileth. But I love you for your fancies.~
@1758 = ~Does that thought never seem to cheapen your life in your own eyes?~
@1759 = ~So our path is predetermined, then?~
@1760 = ~True, the Road doth belong to no man, yet our story is our own. It seemeth to me that we do carry on the deeds of those have gone before.~
@1761 = ~Ah, my love, 'tis indeed a hard portion which hath been assigned to thee. Thy road may well seem dark and dreary.~
@1762 = ~What does that say of *your* road, Saerileth? You go with me, you know.~
@1763 = ~So dark that I cannot see its end, Saerileth.~
@1764 = ~Do you never wish to change your appointed path, my Saerileth?~
@1765 = ~Fanciful I may be, beloved, though 'tis the first time I have been deemed so.~
@1766 = ~Yet this fancy, as thou callest it, doth serve to keep mine eyes ever fixed on the path which Wounded Tyr hath laid before me.~
@1767 = ~I would not dishonor the memory of those who have gone before me.~
@1768 = ~But come, the Road doth beckon us on.~
@1769 = ~Nay, <CHARNAME>. Wherefore shouldst it do so? Indeed, contrariwise, it causeth me to feel th'importance I must do.~
@1770 = ~I must not shame by my deeds those who have gone before me, nor would I have those who will come after find me unworthy.~
@1771 = ~Nay, beloved. The Road doth branch as oft as the Planes. There is ever a choice of how to walk the way we have been given.~
@1772 = ~*Our* Road is what we choose to make it; *the* Road canst be seen only by the gods.~
@1773 = ~My road is lit with the light of thine eyes, mine <CHARNAME>. My path is thine, and I am full of joy that 'tis so.~
@1774 = ~Though the road be dark to thee, yet thy courage doth not falter.~
@1775 = ~And I shall lend to thee my sight, for thy dear presence doth light up the way for me.~
@1776 = ~Change my road? Beloved, by this palm now kissing thine, I would not change it for aught the multiverse couldst offer.~
@1777 = ~My path doth lie with thine, and for that I am ever grateful.~
@1778 = ~Thy light heart doth ever give me joy, my <CHARNAME>. Yet not so do I see the road. I see it stretch forth until the end of the world.~
@1779 = ~To lose the way of thy life wouldst be painful, but 'tis not a pain that thou need'st bear, my love.~
@1780 = ~I don't think we're talking about the same thing, Saerileth.~
@1781 = ~True. I often feel that *my* path has been forced on me.~
@1782 = ~Are you saying that all your happiness is bound up in me?~
