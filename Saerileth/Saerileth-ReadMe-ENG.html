  <p><a NAME="install"><b>I. INSTALLATION</b>
  <ol>
    <li TYPE="i">To install the Saerileth Mod, first download the zip file. Open the zip file and extract all the files inside, which will be two (the .exe, and the folder containing everything else). Drop all these into your BGII - SoA folder. Then click the .exe and install Saerileth. That's it. TOB is required to play.
  </ol>

  <p>Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be
  compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility
  for conflicts.&nbsp;We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official
  patches, Baldurdash, and TeamBG mods.&nbsp;If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please visit our forums.
  <p><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>
  <p><a NAME="uninstall"><b>II. UNINSTALLATION</b>
  <p>Uninstalling is simple. Double-click the setup-Saerileth.exe file and enter the
    given commands for Uninstallation.<br>
  Afterwards, you may delete the following files:
  <ul>
    <li>setup-Saerileth.exe
    <li>setup-Saerileth.tp2
    <li>setup-Saerileth.debug
    <li>and the contents of the &quot;Saerileth&quot; subfolder
  </ul>
  <p></a><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>

  <p><a NAME="compat"><b>III. COMPATIBILITY</b>
  <p>Saerileth is not compatible with the Kiara/Zaiya mod because of that mod's disabling of Watcher's Keep until ToB.
<p>There is nothing to prevent you from installing a concurrent romance patch, but if you do, there will be bugs.  And there will be *nothing* we can do about it. Saerileth does not support concurrent romancing.
 
 <p></a>
 <a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>

  <p><a NAME="faqs"><b>IV. FAQS</b>
  <p>None</p>
  
  <p><b>Notes:</b>
  <p>Notes on the Poetry:  <br>
For bard-specific banter, poetry taken from Sonnet 147, Hamlet, As You Like It, and The Tempest. For Haer'dalis poetry in TOB, it is Sillara's. <br>


<p>Note on Lovetalk music: <br>
Thanks to toughluck who got it for us. It's "Campaign Music 9" from the game "Heroes of Might and Magic III". Thanks for the info, Moongaze.  <br>


<p>Note on Voicing:   <br>
Sillara of the Tamari is the voice of Saerileth. Sir Kalthorine is the voice of Lord Edorem. Moongaze is the voice of Kesevar. nethrin is the voice of Gunshain. Thanks everyone for lending us your vocal chords!  <br>

P.S. SAERI998.ogg and SAERI999.ogg are just there as a joke. They don't actually show up in the game.  <br>


<p>Note on Salvanas-PC interaction: <br>
The following Saerileth fans can find their suggestions in the PC's reaction to Salvanas (v6): Undertaker, Raziel, Dead_Ghost, Wistrik, Lord Kain, Loké, Moongaze, Deathsangel, Phil, happypg, and MajorTomSawyer.    <br>


<p>Note on installing killable Edorem: <br>
In the Creatures folder, you will find an NSEDFAKE.cre and NSEDOREM.cre. Throw the NSEDOREM.cre file in the trash. Then, rename NSEDFAKE.cre to NSEDOREM.cre. There. Now you have an Edorem whom you can *murder*. I hope you feel better. Oh, don't *murder* him until after he gives you the Hammer of Tyr. <br>


<p>Note on Saerileth's new areas: <br>
Spells cannot be used in these new areas. However, there is a way to work around this: if you find yourself having considerable trouble with any battles in the new area(s), just equip your mage's or priest's spells in their spell quickslots. They can then cast their spells in their quickslots. This will make the battle(s) much easier.   <br>

<p>Notes on Saerileth's diction: <br>
"Froward" is a word. It is not a typo. Please check your dictionary before reporting "mistakes".  <br>

  <p><br CLEAR="ALL">
  <b>V. <a NAME="general">GENERAL OVERVIEW</a></b><a NAME="general">  </a>
  <p>--Saerileth is an outer-planar human, sent to Toril for a specific mission. She is a young paladin of Tyr who is romanceable.  <br>
--Saerileth can be picked up in the Temple District, in front of the Order of the Radiant Heart. <br>
--Saerileth has a string-fixer of the hot-key variety. Just highlight her picture and press the L key.    <br>
--Saerileth is 15 years old. <br>
--Saerileth has two quests in SoA and one in ToB.   <br>
--Saerileth's lovetalks and banters are extensive. <br>
--Watch your reputation closely, because she will.<br>
--Watch your alignment closely, because she will.<br>
--Be careful of giving her evil items to carry. <br>
--If you don't take Saerileth the first time you meet her, then you can never take her. And if you drop her, she is forever gone. She is not summonable by the Fate Spirit in ToB.  <br>
--Make sure you do her "Kesevar" quest BEFORE fighting Bodhi for the final time. <br>
	 
  <p><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>

  <p><a NAME="spoilers"><b>VI. SPOILERS</b></a>
  <p>--Saerileth will not join a party led by an evil <CHARNAME>. She will not even spawn into the game.<br>
--Saerileth has strong objections to the thieves' guild quests. If you want to have both Saerileth and Edwin, get him first!<br>
--Yes, Saerileth really *is* protected from evil, despite the lack of shiny flashes on her avatar. We thought it would be too annoying to have that on her permanently, so we removed the appearance. The protection is still there, though.<br>
--The "flowers for Saerileth" option can be accessed only after the Underdark, in a committed romance. Go to Imnesvale, outside the inn.<br>
--The PC must have at least a 16 Charisma to romance Saerileth. <br>
--If the PC's Charisma score drops below 16, the romance ends.  <br>

  <p>Sillara & Nethrin the creators of Saerileth.
  <p>Thanks first of all to CoM_Solaufein for making the areas. Without CoM_Solaufein, Saerileth would have been released in a format very unlike the one you have now! 
  <br>Thanks to our three beta-testers, the "S" triumvirate: Slumlord, Sir Kalthorine, and Sevariat. Your hard work is greatly appreciated, and your thoroughness of testing has helped us release a functioning mod in timely fashion. 
  <br>Thanks also to jcompton, CamDawg, and SimDing0 for help with scripting. 
  <br>Thanks to Sir-Kill for BAM resizing help and to Benjamin for BAM recoloring. 
  <br>Thanks to serdrick for traifying the mod. Thanks to toughluck for finding the Saerileth Romance Music and for making the original default Saerileth portrait. 
  <br>Thanks to BearThing for the ear-tweaking of the toughluck portrait. 
  <br>Thanks to Kai of Candlekeep and XVIII for the alternates! 
  <br>Big thanks to Nome for mirroring the mod on his site. He has really helped me out with data transfer limits! 
  <br>Thanks to Feanor for his unswerving devotion to typo hunting. 
  <br>Thank you, Wistrik for general coding help. 
  <br>Thank you to Dellaster for making the flower .BAMs. 
  <br>Thanks also to all of you at CoM, you who haunt the Saerileth Forum and have given us great suggestions and have helped us squash bugs! You guys are all a great encouragement! ^_^
